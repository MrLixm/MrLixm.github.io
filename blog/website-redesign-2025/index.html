<p>This April 2025 I lost my job due to the <a class="reference external" href="https://variety.com/2025/artisans/global/technicolor-collapse-shockwaves-vfx-1236326607/">Technicolor collapse</a>
, left with an impressive amount of time I decided to tackle a long standing
project of mine: entirely renovating this website.</p>
<p>Why though ? I already had a pretty decent website. Well as much as moth are attracted
by your bedroom lights, programmer are attracted to writing new code over and over again,
or doing their thing their own way. Anyway I got bored and a bit frustrated of what I
designed back in 2021 and wanted a change. It's my website I can do whatever the fuck
I want <img alt="" class="emoji-role inline" src="../../.static/images/emojis/yes-cool.png" title="yes-cool" />.</p>
<p>And I'm verry happy with what I achieved, it's not just a backend change, it's also a
change of direction for what I want to communicate. It feels more personal, more funky
and also more political.</p>
<section id="the-before">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#the-before" role="doc-backlink">The before</a></h2>
<p>In 2021 I decided to base my whole website on the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/">Pelican</a>
framework: &quot;a static site generator, written in Python&quot;. At that time I mainly wanted a
blog, and I was familiar with Python (not that you need it for Pelican)
so it was all I needed to get started. It's a
really great tool because if you don't know the basics of the web, everything is abstract
as python config and .rst/.md files. And it's decently extendable.</p>
<p>Pelican propose &quot;themes&quot; to style your website, I initially went with <a class="reference external" href="https://mcss.mosra.cz/">https://mcss.mosra.cz/</a>
because it looked like a pretty well-rounded solution that also extended the Pelican
framework with a lot of useful features. I then slowly added my own css to further
customize the website with my own sauce.</p>
<p>For hosting the website I went with <a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> because
I was started to get familiar with git at the time and it's just free. Because I was
getting familiar with it, the workflow was quite messy for some time. Especially
the branchs where I swapped multiple time the source pelican website branch and the
published html website branch, not knowing which one should be <span class="docutils literal">dev</span> or <span class="docutils literal">main</span> (and
found out later that we usually put the html in a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gh-pages</span></span> branch).</p>
<p>As for the site design I aimed for something that feels polished, serious and
professional. There was not that much unique content, mostly a blog, a custom index
and a contact page.</p>
</section>
<section id="starting-over">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#starting-over" role="doc-backlink">Starting over</a></h2>
<p>The long-standing project was always to drop Pelican, it's a great tool for what it is
designed, but I had a bigger scope, I wanted more freedom and I wanted control.
Obviously because I'm a developer &quot;I can write it better for myself&quot; ! Which is true,
making a software for public usage requires a lot of trade-off.
But if you also think for the future having a website with too much dependencies make
it less reliable to still work as easily in 10years. If I write the code, I can
maintain it myself and don't depend on others (which could also be argued as a disadvantage).</p>
<p>But before designing anything I tried to think at what do I actually need, all software
are driven by specific needs, forgetting them and you just write code to write code which
is the open-door to <a class="reference external" href="https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-complexity">unecessary complexity</a>.
I wouldn't drop Pelican to build something more complex than it right ?</p>
<p>So what I want is a website, i.e. share information on the web.
For doing so you just need to write html files, maybe a bit of css, and put that on a server.
That is the most simple need.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the server-part it was initially handed by GitHub pages,
and I don't want to deal with that yet. I can
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version-control</a>
my code and publish it for the web at the same place and that is good for me now.</p></li>
<li><p>For html files, the idea of just not bothering with complexity and just straight writing
html files is tempting. But writing long blog post and tutorials with html syntax is
really painful. Which is why the Pelican design to use an human-friendly source format
like restructuredText or Markdown and translate it to html is a great idea. And I want
to keep it. <em>But I still want to be able to just write a whole page in html if I wanted
to.</em></p></li>
</ul>
<aside class="admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">restructuredText or Markdown ?</p>
<p>I still needed to make a decision on which format I would write my long-form
content in. Pelican offers both but I can only stick to one and have less code to
maintain. The choice was already made because I picked rst with Pelican, which was
preferred by the m.css extension I was using.
Still, if I need to write my own code to convert rst to html, I found out that
rst design was more prone to this task and also more prone to be extended (with its
concept of <em>directives</em>).</p>
</aside>
<aside class="admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">What about dynamic web pages ?</p>
<p>Pelican and m.css showed me that static sites are fine for my need. I don't need
Javascript or any other language to dynamically generate content on my website.
Whatever I publish on my side is what the user will see. I don't need the
extra-complexity.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="building-the-code-library">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#building-the-code-library" role="doc-backlink">Building the code library</a></h2>
<p>With that formalized, I knew what &quot;destination&quot; to code to, there was still the &quot;how do
I get there&quot; to solve. This involved quite a bit more of research, trial and errors
but I am too lazy to write a whole chapter about it so I'll be skipping that whole part
<img alt="" class="emoji-role inline" src="../../.static/images/emojis/cat-sleepy-bb.webp" title="cat-sleepy-bb" />.</p>
<p>You can get more information on the finished result by checking the <a class="reference external" href="../../.doc/index.html">documentation</a>
or the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/MrLixm/MrLixm.github.io/tree/main/libs/lxmsite">Github repo</a>.
You will notice I share a lot of concepts with Pelican, but I implemented those my way.</p>
<p>One of the hardest part was understanding the <span class="docutils literal">docutils</span> library. I would qualify the
code as not very readable and not very-well documented which made it very hard to
understand how to implement my own features. Seeing how complex the code is makes me
wonder if picking rst as file format was the right choice ?
(I'm very tented to write my own markup syntax but that's not an exercice I already
done and will probably become another rabbit-hole).</p>
<p>Then after a few test or a very small version of my website I was satisified
with the workflow and started re-building the website content. This was mostly
copy/pasted and fixing all the previous website content so it all works with the new
workflow.</p>
<p>And only when the port was over that I started bulding new stuff and redesigning the pages.</p>
</section>
<section id="redesign">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#redesign" role="doc-backlink">Redesign</a></h2>
<p>Now for the most fun part, what do I want my website to looks like ?</p>
<p>Even if I found
the current design good enough and quite polished, I wanted a changes of values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to break up from a &quot;professional, clean&quot; aesthetic and make my website fun,
I want it to be funky, kind of messy but still polished. It must feels like me: I am
nerdy but I don't think I'm boring, I can be quite organized but also scatter in a lot
of direction. I am colorful and I like green. Let me just put things that I find fun or
funny on my website; I can, it's my website.
But also let's not forget that for a website to be really personal, it means it must
be political. Not just a facade: how really do you treat with other human beings.</p>

<img alt="screenshot of the new index page" class="inline" src="screenshot-new-index.png" />
<figcaption>
<p>The index page design exactly match those intentions.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Luckly for me I have some modest graphic-design skills, allowing me to be quite
creative and make the whole process smoother and less frustrating. Still, where do I
start ?</p>
<section id="photography-portfolio">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#photography-portfolio" role="doc-backlink">Photography portfolio</a></h3>
<p>If I look at my logbook, the first new design I come up with was a page to present
a &quot;photography sessions&quot; (i.e. a bunch of shots grouped together). Not very interesting,
but being able to add my photography portfolio was one of the reason of that whole
website renovation. So I started by having a look at what I could do there.</p>
<figure class="inline">
<img alt="a 2 column layout with photo and text interleaved" class="inline" src="screenshot-draft-photography-session.png" />
<figcaption>
<p>the initial design I drafted in Figma</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the key constraint in designing that portfolio page was the usage of captions.
I write a caption for all my photography which acts as an alt-text for visually
impaired people. I could just have implemented it as only <span class="docutils literal">alt</span> attributes on images
but I spend so much time writing them that I don't see a reason to only make them
visible to people with screen readers. Thus, I developed a system that allow me to
arbitrarly place them in-between images.</p>
<p>Another issue with those captions is that because they act as alt-text, they become
&quot;metadata&quot; of the image. But then where do I write it ? If I put it in the rst document
this mean I couldn't use the image elsewhere with that caption. Embed the caption in the
image metadata ? That's cumbersome because editing image metadata require external tools.
My choice instead was to create an additional &quot;meta&quot; file for each image.
I wanted the format to be very human friendly, so no json, but I didn't want an external
dependency that yaml would have required. So I made my own very simple syntax (
that fits in 38 lines).</p>
<p>And now that have I have a specific file for the caption, why not also use it
to specify other type of metadata that I wish to display along the photography ?</p>
<p>Example of .meta file:</p>
<pre class="highlight literal-block" title="Block of code in yaml language."><span class="nt">__format__</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">1</span>

<span class="nt">camera</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Minolta X-500</span>
<span class="nt">caption</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">No Facho ! A powerfull message on the white wall of some private property.</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Even more contrasty due to the intense sun there was on that day.</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">And it&#39;s understandable given the context, we are in middle of the french</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">legislative elections; the far right as menacing as ever.</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">Those message of resistance has been flourishing all over the neighbourhood.</span>
</pre>
<p><em>Note that keys have no meaning (except for</em> <span class="docutils literal">caption</span> <em>) and I can add as much as
I want in every file.</em></p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>An interesting issue that came along the way was how to display images in fullscreen ?
I.e. you click the image and it fill the screen height while reducing opacity for
anything else. The easiest solution would probably be javascript but I really wanted
to see how far I could go without using JS on my website at all.
One of the solution I found was pretty satisfiying: <a class="reference external" href="https://sylvaindurand.org/overlay-image-in-pure-css/">https://sylvaindurand.org/overlay-image-in-pure-css/</a>.
It's biggest drawback being that you have to duplicate the image, fortunately the way
I add images is handled by a rst directive so duplicating content is hassleless.</p>

<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The next part of my photography portfolio was designing the landing page. Where the
visitor can have a quick look at all my projects.
I wanted something original, quite eye-catchy but that doesn't sacrifice picture
presentation. I think I found the main direction pretty quickly as I remembered an
incredible recent website that archived a lot of film box packaging: <a class="reference external" href="https://fp-archive.com/">https://fp-archive.com/</a>
And on their I immediately stopped on the Fujifilm ones, of course because of their
strong usage of green. Their packaging instantly became my main reference for designing
the page.</p>
<figure class="inline">
<img alt="a photography of a flattened box of 120mm Fujichrome 100D" class="inline" src="photography-inspiration-1.png" />
<figcaption>
<p>Look at this color palette, gnnnnnn so good</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And this is the final wireframe design I sketched in Figma:</p>
<img alt="screenshot of the design wireframe that inspire strongly from the previously mentioned packaging." class="inline" src="photography-figma-design.png" />
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I had to somehow keep the iconic Fuji logo, that brings an important complementary
color. I tried first to have my first + last name but it was not pretty and ended up
only using my first name. I couldn't keep all the original logo characteristics because
of the different letters so I aimed for something that feels like it but looks good
on its own.</p></li>
<li><p>the packaging has a lot of text but a photography portfolio usually doesn't. To add
a bit more text I found the idea of translating some of the headings in other
languages, as it's already the case on the reference. I choose french, my native
language, with polish and italian that are some of my family origins.</p></li>
<li><p>for the font I had to find something quite similar and was mostly limited by the
free foundries I already had. I could probably have found better but ended-up
using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/clash-display">Clash Display</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I kept the popular &quot;square grid layout&quot; from social medias to display sessions. I
don't like to have my images cropped but it allow for a more compact and tidy view.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And this is what it looks like once implemented in html and css:</p>
<img alt="screenshot of the final web page" class="inline" src="photography-site-screenshot.png" />
<p>You can obviously check it by yourself by visiting <a class="reference external" href="../../work/photography/index.html">the page itself</a>
(that may have changed since).</p>
<div class="column-split docutils container">
<img alt="screenshot of the page with smartphone dimensions" class="inline" src="photography-site-screenshot-responsive.png" style="width: 65%;" />
<div class="docutils container">
<p>One important difference is the background. I tried to reproduce the grainy feeling
of the packaging's cardboard texture. This is done by mixing a bunch of svg noise with
blending modes:</p>
<pre class="highlight literal-block" title="Block of code in css language."><span class="nt">background</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;noise.dust.dark.svg&quot;</span><span class="o">),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;noise.dust.light.svg&quot;</span><span class="o">),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">url</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;noise.svg&quot;</span><span class="o">),</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">var</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nt">--bg-color</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="nt">background-blend-mode</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">normal</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">normal</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">overlay</span><span class="o">;</span>
</pre>
<p>The svg were generated with the help of <a class="reference external" href="https://noice.vercel.app/">https://noice.vercel.app/</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fffuel.co/nnnoise/">https://www.fffuel.co/nnnoise/</a>.</p>
<p>⇐ The last tricky part for this page was making it responsive. As you can see the
header relies a lot on horizontality which become quite limited on smartphones.</p>
<p>I think I'm satisfied with the result but it's not fantastic, the &quot;fuji style&quot;
logo is intended to be displayed in a corner which would have made a lot of
vertical space wasted if implemented as such.</p>
<p>The main heading wrapping is not very pretty but I think that's better than
making it smaller to fit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But to conclude the work on the photography section of my site, I had to upload
everything I shot and already published on other socials. And I think that was the
most annoying task. I can spend an hour just to add a single session. Picking the
images, the layout, rewriting some captions, ...</p>

<section id="the-importance-of-typography">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#the-importance-of-typography" role="doc-backlink">The importance of typography.</a></h3>
<p>I am not very good with typography, but I do love them. I love endlessy scrolling fonts
library or <a class="reference external" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/&#64;liamcollod/112388315897499867">visiting excentric designer website</a>
to find the perfect typeface.</p>
<p>However my process for finding fonts initially started as for most developer:
browsing Google Fonts. Just because it's convenient and easy to integrate in your website.
But fuck Google, I haven't migrated from Gmail to <a class="reference external" href="https://tuta.com/">Tuta</a> just to
have those blood-suckers also squatting my website. Fortunately I discovered a
workaround a few weeks ago: <a class="reference external" href="https://fonts.bunny.net/">https://fonts.bunny.net/</a>. It's as convenient as google
font to use, has all google fonts, but is not google. It just sucks for finding fonts.</p>
<p>Still, why I am being so lazy ? I just said I love browsing fonts, I have bookmarked
quite a few typographic website so why do I stick with the &quot;google font library&quot; ? Just
because of the vendor-hosting ? Common you can just copy/paste a bunch of otf/ttf/woff
and write 2 lines of css. The real reason was mostly that I didn't need anything fancy,
the most popular fonts are in the Google catalogue and works just fine. But hey I said
I want to get fancy for this website ! Time to go off-road ... <img alt="" class="emoji-role inline" src="../../.static/images/emojis/malicious-intentions.png" title="malicious-intentions" /></p>
<p>I think my approach to pick fonts was the inverse of what designer usually do. I started
to browse for fonts I like visually first, and then build the page style and design
around that font; or at least get inspired from it.</p>
<p>With the thousands of free fonts online it's hard to make a choice right ? Well
amongst some of the type foundries I got some with a really interesting feature: they
are political.</p>

<p>And political is what I wanted my website to be more. I want to showcase the work of
minorities. I want to highlight creators when I can. This is also the reason that
all the decorative fonts on the index and work pages have their name and a link
displayed next to them. They are such a crucial piece of puzzle for a website that
they deserve credits.</p>
<p>And as of the time I'm writting this post, these are the fonts I ended up using:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://pippin.gimp.org/0xA000/">0xA000</a>: picked for its unique &quot;tech&quot; style; I actually not ended up using it as much as I wanted.</p></li>

<section id="making-a-c-v">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#making-a-c-v" role="doc-backlink">Making a C.V.</a></h3>
<p>A C.V. is often asked for any job candidature, and you know how asking for files
online is still a mess. However having it as an html page means you can just drop a link
which is quite convenient ! Still, we need the .pdf because not all automated forms
expect an url and will ask a file, .pdf having the most chance of being opened.</p>
<p>One cool trick I learned is that you can easily export html to pdf using your browser !
Press <span class="docutils literal">ctrl+p</span> (print shortcut), instead of a printer choose &quot;Export as PDF&quot; and voilà.</p>
<img alt="screenshot of the &quot;print&quot; window from Firefox, with my cv in a A4 format." class="inline" src="cv-save_to_pdf.png" />
<p>However you might run in formatting issue now. If the cv is part of our website we
dont want the navigation bar or the footer.
My solution was to create 2 cv pages, one for browsing from the site with the usual
navigation. The other I called &quot;full screen&quot; which is just the cv content. It was
quite straightforward to build using Jinja template inheritance to avoid duplicating
code.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="../../work/cv.html">cv.html</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="../../work/cv.fullscreen.html">cv.fullscreen.html</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Another trick I found is for styling, because you might not want a screen wide
html page to be layout the same as a A4-like document. There I use the special CSS
media query <span class="docutils literal">print</span>:</p>
<pre class="highlight literal-block" title="Block of code in css language."><span class="p">@</span><span class="k">media</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">print</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="c">/* we need much smaller horizontal margin when &quot;printing&quot; */</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">read-area</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="k">margin</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">10</span><span class="kt">%</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre>
<p>Also because I had to reduce the overall document scale in the dialog to have it fit,
graphics that were 1px thin like borders became barely visible. I used the same css
trick above to make all borders 2px wide when &quot;printing&quot;.</p>

<section id="search-bar">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#search-bar" role="doc-backlink">Search Bar</a></h3>
<p>I think finding information is a critical part for most websites. Maybe not that
critical for small personal websites but it can be frustrating for the user to
lost himself on your site, or even for you if you write resources that are never found.</p>
<p>Yet finding content was kept at the minimum viable level for this redesign: a clear
nav bar and structure. I actually removed some navigation compared to what Pelican
was offering me.</p>
<p>But at the few days before wrapping up this post and the site redesign
someone <a class="reference external" href="https://types.pl/&#64;quat/114615740350510081">shared on Mastodon</a>
exactly what I was looking for:</p>
<div class="url-preview-box docutils container">
<a class="reference external" href="https://pagefind.app/">

<div class="url-preview-image docutils container">

</div>
<div class="url-preview-description docutils container">

</div>
</div>
<p>A search function for static sites ! And it can be pip installed. Most impressive
is that as hinted by the mastodon post author, it only took a few dozen of minutes
to have it fully integrated in this website (few more to squash some bugs and polish
the style) !</p>
</section>
<section id="other-stuff">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#other-stuff" role="doc-backlink">Other stuff</a></h3>
<p>I added a resources page. It's goal overlap a bit with the blog and work pages but I
think it's a large enough need that it required its own page. Also it replace the
previous subpage &quot;asset&quot; that I created for 2 specific cases. I made sure to
redirect those to their new <span class="docutils literal">resources</span> location.</p>
<p>Compared to Pelican I removed the tags/author/categories pages that allowed to browse
all the blog post with that specific field. I didn't feel it bring much value for now
as I don;t have that much content. But I know finding information is an important feature
so I plan to at elast implement some form of global search later.</p>
<p>Oh and I added small easter-eggs all around 👀 (as in, you need an interaction to
find them).</p>

<p>While redoing my website, I also decided it was time to do a little bit of cleaning
in my &quot;cyber-life&quot;. There was 2 main topic I wanted to tackle for a long time but whose

a lot of time and there's a lot of uncertainty you need to navigate.</p>

<p>I don't think it's necessary to explain why one would want to get rid of Google, or at
least I'm too lazy to put the effort into an explanation.
But those bastard doesn't align with my values and I don't want
anymore to justify giving credits to fascist simply for my personal confort.</p>

in the previous year that made me quite mitigated.
Though I have been given some <a class="reference external" href="https://medium.com/&#64;ovenplayer/does-proton-really-support-trump-a-deeper-analysis-and-surprising-findings-aed4fee4305e">contradictory sources</a>
I went with Tuta (and I skip over the other alternatives I haven't really looked into).</p>
<p>Changing your email provider is a big thing, this mean that in theory you need to
inform all websites, entity and person to use that new email adress. Imagine
the new provider you choose suck ? You will have to go through all that mess again
to migrate back ?
Well there's a solution: routing your email through a custom domain. All email
providers provides you a custom domain, like <span class="docutils literal">username&#64;gmail.com</span> or
<span class="docutils literal">username&#64;tuta.io</span> but some allow you to use your own.</p>

<p>Owning a custom domain was a first for me, I had a lot of questions but it ended-up
okay of an experience. I went with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gandi.net/en">Gandi</a> as domain
provider (they are french-based) and bought <span class="docutils literal">liamcollod.xyz</span> (11€ for 2years).
I then followed the Tuta instructions to use it as custom domain for my email, that
way I could have as much email adresseses I want on that domain. However after doing
a bunch of tests, and email update on some websites I found one issue: the <span class="docutils literal">.xyz</span>
top-domain is more prone to be blocked by spam filters 😨 That's really bad if you send
a mail and you can't know if it end-up in the recipient spam that he may never check ...
(I also learn that some filters blocks new domains for the first month after their creation).
Welp, I had to buy another domain <span class="docutils literal">liamcollod.eu</span>. It seems that anyway, except for
the bigger email provider domains, everything is a potential spam for some.</p>
<p>Now that I have a custom domain, I need to pick the email adress I want to use,
because the domain is only the part right to the <span class="docutils literal">&#64;</span>, you need to pick a left part.
And the magic is that you can setup as much as you want ! For example I picked
<span class="docutils literal">contact&#64;liamcollod.eu</span> as a general email address. But I have another one that
looks like <span class="docutils literal">heyo&#64;liamcollod.eu</span> that I will only give to my relatives and mutuals.
Depending on how your email providers works, you can also setup aliases, an infinity of
email adresses that can be unique per website you create an account on !</p>
<p>That's one advantage, the other is that I can now
change email provider (like if I decide to finally go from Tuta to Proton Mail)
without having to update my email adress anywhere.
I just need to update a few settings on my domain provider to tell to redirect
the mail from Tuta to Proton. My email stays <span class="docutils literal">contact&#64;liamcollod.eu</span>.</p>
<aside class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">important</p>
<p>Note that you &quot;own the email&quot; as long as you pay the domain provider (Gandi for me).
So it's not a &quot;free unlimited hack&quot;, you are still dependent on the will of
a third party for your email to exists.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">note</p>
<p>Before you go with Tuta, here's a few thing I have spotted (which are not a blocker
for me but may be for you):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tutanota/comments/wlrf1s/automatically_email_forwarding/">No automatic mail forwarding</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>No &quot;favorite this mail&quot; system. You can however since recently created labels on mail.</p></li>
<li><p>Inbox rules system is quite basic.</p></li>
<li><p>Accounts <em>on the free tier</em> are deleted if not used for 6 month.</p></li>
<li><p>You can only use their client app (desktop and mobile) due to the encryption.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which implies you can't add your emails from other providers (but you can
switch between multiple Tuta accounts).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For now I am quite pleased with the user experience (it feels polished) and would
definitively recommend them as long as your need are pretty simple.</p>
</aside>
<p>Gmail was my main Google dependency. I didn't get rid of it as I can't just stop using
my 12 years-old email address but it feels good to know I may just delete it and
it will not be catastrophic. Slowly, I am building alternatives and that makes me
confident.</p>
<p>The next step is getting rid of other Google dependencies, luckly my usage was
already pretty small:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">Google Calendar</span>: replaced by Tuta Calendar !</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">Google Authentificator</span>: gone now, see next section !</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">Google Drive</span>: never used, I was already on Mega since years.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">Google Sheets</span>: not simple, there's not that much resources online. Excel is not
not a solution. I'm just using it for accountability so I may explore solutions
outside the traditional spreadsheet format.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">YouTube</span>: well it's hard to get rid of this one but I'm still investigating.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">Google Maps</span>: I need to start using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>
but I don't know how robust their
&quot;itinary&quot; feature is (and also how much solid is their local business referencing
and reviewing).</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="improving-how-i-manage-my-passwords">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#improving-how-i-manage-my-passwords" role="doc-backlink">Improving how I manage my passwords</a></h3>
<p>Until know, my method was the good old physical notebook of passwords. Very secure
but quite dangerous (I only have ony copy!) and inpractical (always take a few seconds
to find the password for the exact site you need).</p>
<p>I might be digital-tech-savy, I don't know much about cyber-security if the very basics.
So it's quite hard to navigate amongst all the possibility to store a password. Should I
really trust a password manager ? How can it fail to protect my data ?</p>
<p>I still can't answer those questions because as much as I like to go in depth for each
topic I explore, I already had too much on my plate and just went on relying on
what the majority use: <a class="reference external" href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> (with the help of a few
<a class="reference external" href="https://tuta.com/blog/best-password-manager">comparison articles</a>).</p>
<p>From what I understand, it's basically an encrypted database that is stored on some
company cloud. Only you can decrypt the database with your master password. So it better
be a good password, but the only one you have to remember !</p>
<p>While looking at password manager I also discovered another concept: passphrases.</p>
<figure class="inline">
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://xkcd.com/936/">
<img alt="a full transcript is available at https://xkcd.com/936/" class="inline" src="xkcd-passphrases.png" />
</a>
</figure>
<p>I don't know how hard I should trust those but it seems quite reliable so I gave it a go.</p>
<p>To generate a passphrase I found:</p>
<div class="url-preview-box docutils container">
<a class="reference external" href="https://diceware.dmuth.org/">

</div>

<p>But also a slighty different generator with a very nice user interface:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And <a class="reference external" href="https://bitwarden.com/password-generator/">bitwarden password generator</a>
also offers passphrases.</p>
<p>With that it was time to start the big update ! Going through every website I had
on my notebook and update the password and email, registering them in Bitwarden.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I didn't registred all the websites in my password manager: the ~5 most critical
are still in my physical notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>I actually didn't update all the website I ever had an account on. I made a list and
sorted them by importance, only updating the most used. For the other I will update
them progressively, when login back to them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For few of this websites, I had <abbr title="2 Factor Authentification">2FA</abbr> in place. Until
now I was using Google Authentificator to managed my codes but I want to get rid of
Google. Again, I search for some comparison with alternatives and end up on
<a class="reference external" href="https://getaegis.app">Aegis</a>. Most importantly it allow to export your tokens
as backup. I can loose my smartphone and not become locked-out of those important
accounts.</p>

<section id="nuking-facebook-fuck-you-zuckenberg">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#nuking-facebook-fuck-you-zuckenberg" role="doc-backlink">Nuking facebook (fuck you Zuckenberg)</a></h3>
<p>With how Meta decided aiming at being one the leaders of the new techno-fascist empire
the USA are building I came to the conclusion I also want to delete my Facebook account.
I haven't used Facebook for years so I'm lucky that's not a big deal for me.</p>
<p>I check if there is anything to backup, maybe a few photos, ha wait ... messenger.
I still have one group of friend using it.</p>
<p>“Ask them to migrate to another platform”, worth a try, expect I know they are lazy
bastard and that creating a new account on a new app just for one group chat with
me is too much. I will have to convince them with time, but in the meanwhile I
need another solution right now.</p>
<p>And I already have another solution. A year ago when Meta had to offer Facebook-less
messenger account to its user after an EU law I did created one. So let’s check it out.</p>
<p>First thing I want to check is can I share my messenger contact easily ? I ask my
partner to search for my account on messenger, as if they wanted to contact me, but
they only find my facebook-linked account. Hmm, how do you share and find a
messenger account, there must be some kind of user name or identifier right ? And
indeed there is, you are supposed to have a messenger username that allow to share
you account using a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://m.me/</span></span> link. Expect mine is empty. Like I don’t have
an username 😵‍ Well lucky for me there is an option to edit your username,
let’s give that a try.</p>
<p>However whatever username I try to put in the field just give me an error, not
“username taken” or anything explicit, just no it’s not possible, for anything
goofy or serious that I try. So I look at their documentation that explains what
is allowed as username but all my attempts match their requirements so what
is going on ??</p>
<p>Turns out that from a reddit post, its because my account don’t have a verified
phone number, so I can’t edit my username ! And they obviously don't tell you !</p>
<p>Ok let’s add a phone number then. I go my account settings &gt; personal information
&gt; add phone number, enter my phone number … huh ? The “Next” button is greyed-out
and I can’t click it. Again whatever phone number I fill I just can’t validate it.
Absolutely crazy ! And can’t find what is the reason this time. I give up for
today and will try again tomorrow ...</p>
<p>Next day, but you know what never mind, let’s nuke the account and start from scratch.
Wait what !? 30 days before the account is deleted ? and if its cancelled if I
login with it ? Well I will have to use another email address in the meanwhile but fine.</p>
<p>Ok so new account, after deleting the other one I’m automatically put on a screen
which ask me to login with my existing Facebook account or another one, I try to
click &quot;Another Account&quot;, I get a new login page but also a button to create a new
account at the bottom (I would have expected it to be hidden elsewhere). Great
finally something straightforward, so create account, without Facebook option, I
choose to use my phone number over my email, all good, until the step I must submit
my confirmation code that is sent to my phone number. Waiting 1,5,10min nothing.
And there is no option to ask to send another code. Unlucky or just another
intentional blocker ?
Well let’s go back a few step until it ask the phone number again and refill
everything ... same issue I never receive the code.</p>
<p>Fuck this, let’s cancel the whole process and go back on the login screen,
I get a popup that ask me if I really want to cancel the account creation,
so yes. Let’s try agaaaain, create a new account ... huh ? Now I get redirected
to a webpage that tells me it’s not possible to create a new account at this
moment !!?? Welp time to give up and come back later.</p>
<p>Turns out I just had to close the messenger app to retry the account creation,
but I still get blocked in the end at the phone verification step ...</p>
<p>You want to know how the story ends ? I retry 3 days later to create a new account
and this time everything works without issue 💀</p>

<section id="custom-domain-for-my-website">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#custom-domain-for-my-website" role="doc-backlink">Custom domain for my website</a></h3>
<p>I explained how I acquired 2 custom domains in <a class="reference external" href="#getting-rid-of-gmail">Getting rid of gmail</a>
and their usage for my emails, but it is most evident that the main other reason you
want a custom domain is for your website.</p>
<p>I didn't use my <span class="docutils literal">.xyz</span> domain for email because of spam detection, but this should
be less of a problem for a website url. And <span class="docutils literal">.xyz</span> is much more relevant than
<span class="docutils literal">.eu</span> for my profile (3d space coordinates ...) !
Therefore I want my website to be accessible at  <span class="docutils literal">liamcollod.xyz</span>.</p>
<aside class="admonition highlight-block">
<p>I'm a big noob with how internet works so I also learned that <span class="docutils literal">www.liamcollod.xyz</span>
is a subdomain of <span class="docutils literal">liamcollod.xyz</span>, which just redirects to it. One may not even
set it up but it was recommended as people may be familiar with starting all
website adresses with <span class="docutils literal">www</span>.</p>
</aside>
<p>To use that domain, I had a first look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">GitHub documentation</a>.
My first issue is that the documentation explain the how, but not really the why
or showcase the end-result. Like what is an apex-domain ? I just want to use my
custom domain for my <span class="docutils literal">Mrlixm.github.io</span> repository, not the other repository
where I host other sites.</p>
<p>Cross-referencing information from <a class="reference external" href="https://insidemordecai.com/custom-domains-with-github-pages/">different sites</a>
I decide to just follow all the steps and just see what it does:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>I configure the apex domain</p></li>
<li><p>I update the repo with the CNAME file</p></li>
<li><p>I configure the <span class="docutils literal">www</span> subdomain</p></li>
</ol>
<p>First step was without issue but step 2. and 3. were more complicated. For 2., this file
is automatically created by GitHub when you edit the repository settings
as they tell you to do. But it is created as a new commit on the <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gh-pages</span></span> branch
(or whatever is published to github pages), which will be lost when I deploy a new site
version. What need to be done is add the CNAME file (with its correct content) to the
source branch and make sure that when I deploy the site, it is copied at the root.</p>
<p>For 3. it was a mix of different problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I wrongly set the CNAME record on Gandi side, I was missing the dot at the end of the value (<span class="docutils literal">mrlixm.github.io.</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>The DNS propagataion was quite slow, the subdomain only worked the next day; after
I spend one hour double checking I did everything correctly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The end-result is that all my other repository also got my custom domain;
like <a class="reference external" href="https://mrlixm.github.io/picture-lab-lxm/">https://mrlixm.github.io/picture-lab-lxm/</a> redirects to <a class="reference external" href="https://liamcollod.xyz/picture-lab-lxm/">https://liamcollod.xyz/picture-lab-lxm/</a>.
I didn't really want for this but I also don't want to spend more time on this, so
I just leave it as it is.</p>
