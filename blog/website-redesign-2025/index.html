<p>This april 2025 I lost my job due to the Technicolor collapse, left with an impressive
amount of time I decided to tackle a long standing project of mine: entirely
renovating this website.</p>
<p>Why though ? I already had a pretty decent website. Well as much as moth are attracted
by your bedroom lights, programmer are attracted to writing new code over and over again,
or doing their thing their own way. Anyway I got bored and a bit frustrated of what I
designed back in 2021 and wanted a change. It's my website I can do whatever the fuck
I want <img alt="" class="emoji-role inline" src="../../.static/images/emojis/yes-cool.png" title="yes-cool" />.</p>
<p>And I'm verry happy with what I achieved, a site that feels more personal, more funky
and on which I have the whole control because I wrote (nearly) every single line
of code that make it.</p>
<section id="the-before">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-1" role="doc-backlink">The before</a></h2>
<p>I don't know shit about web-development if that its common to use &quot;backend&quot; and &quot;frontend&quot;
to describe the different building blocks of a website. I like those word so I'll
be using them to describe my whole website framework.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">frontend</span>: I assume this is the visible part of the website, what you are directly
interacting with on the web.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="docutils literal">backend</span>: this is whatever is used to generate the frontend</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In 2021 I decided to base my whole website on the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/">Pelican</a>
framework: &quot;a static site generator, written in Python&quot;. At that time I mainly wanted a
blog, and I knew how to code in python so it was all I needed to get started. It's a
really great tool because if you don't know the basics of the web, everything is abstract
as python config and .rst/.md files. And it's decently extendable.</p>
<p>Pelican propose &quot;themes&quot; to style your website, I initially went with <a class="reference external" href="https://mcss.mosra.cz/">https://mcss.mosra.cz/</a>
because it looked like a pretty well-rounded solution that also extended the Pelican
framework with a lot of useful features. I then slowly added my own css to further
customize the website with my own sauce.</p>
<p>For hosting the website I went with <a class="reference external" href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> because
I was started to get familiar with git at the time and it's just free. Because I was
getting familiar with it, the workflow was quite messy for some time. Especially
the branchs where I swapped multiple time the source pelican website branch and the
published html website branch, not knowing which one shoudl be <span class="docutils literal">dev</span> or <span class="docutils literal">main</span> (and
found out later that we usually put the html in a <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gh-pages</span></span> branch).</p>
</section>
<section id="starting-over">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-2" role="doc-backlink">Starting over</a></h2>
<p>The long-standing project was always to drop Pelican, it's a great tool for what it is
designed, but I had a bigger scope, I wanted more freedom and I wanted control.
Obviously because I'm a developer &quot;I can write it better for myself&quot; ! Which is true,
making a software for public usage requires a lot of trade-off.
But if you also think for the future having a website with too much dependencies make
it less reliable to still work as easily in 10years. If I write the code, I can
maintain it myself and don't depend on others (which could also be argued as a disadvantage).</p>
<p>But before designing anything I tried to think at what do I actually need, all software
are driven by specific needs, forgetting them and you just write code to write code which
is the open-door to <a class="reference external" href="https://grugbrain.dev/#grug-on-complexity">unecessary complexity</a>.
I wouldn't drop Pelican to build something more complex than it right ?</p>
<p>So what I want is a website, i.e. share information on the web.
For doing so you just need to write html files, maybe a bit of css, and put that on a server.
That is the most simple need.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>For the server-part it was initially handed by GitHub pages,
and I don't want to deal with that yet. I can
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version-control</a>
my code and publish it for the web at the same place and that is good for me now.</p></li>
<li><p>For html files, the idea of just not bothering with complexity and just straight writing
html files is tempting. But writing long blog post and tutorials with html syntax is
really painful. Which is why the Pelican design to use an human-friendly source format
like restructuredText or Markdown and translate it to html is a great idea. And I want
to keep it. But I still want to be able to just write a whole page in html if I wanted
to.</p></li>
</ul>
<aside class="admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">restructuredText or Markdown ?</p>
<p>I still needed to make a decision on which format I would write my long-form
content in. Pelican offers both but I can only stick to one and have less code to
maintain. The choice was already made because I picked rst with Pelican, which was
preferred by the m.css extension I was using.
Still, if I need to write my own code to convert rst to html, I found out that
rst design was more prone to this task and also more prone to be extended (with its
concept of directives).</p>
</aside>
<aside class="admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">What about dynamic web pages ?</p>
<p>Pelican and m.css showed me that static sites are fine for my need. I don't need
Javascript or any other language to dynamically generate content on my website.
Whatver I publish on my side is what the user will see. I don't need the
extra-complexity.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="building-the-code-library">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-3" role="doc-backlink">Building the code library</a></h2>
<p>With that formalized, I knew what &quot;destination&quot; to code to, there was still the &quot;how do
I get there&quot; to solve. This involved quite a bit more of research, trial and errors
but I am too lazy to write a whole chapter about it so I'll be skipping that whole part
<img alt="" class="emoji-role inline" src="../../.static/images/emojis/cat-sleepy-bb.webp" title="cat-sleepy-bb" />.</p>
<p>You can get more information on the finished result by checking the <a class="reference external" href=".....docindex.html">documentation</a>.
You will notice I share a lot of concepts with Pelican, but I implemented those my way.</p>
<p>Just assume that after a few test or a very small version of my website I was satisified
with the workflow and started re-building the website content. This was mostly
copy/pasted and fixing all the previous website content so it all works with the new
workflow.</p>
<p>And only when the port over that I started bulding new stuff and redesigning the pages.</p>
</section>
<section id="redesign">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-4" role="doc-backlink">Redesign</a></h2>
<p>And now for the most fun part, what do I want my website to look like ?</p>
<p>Even if I found
the current design good enough and quite polished, I wanted a changes of values.
I want to break up from a &quot;professional, clean&quot; aesthetic and make my website fun,
I want it to be funky, kind of messy but still polished. It must feels like me: I am
nerdy but I don't think I'm boring, I can be quite organized but also scatter in a lot
of direction. I am colorful and I like green. Let me just put things that I find fun or
funny on my website, I can it's my website.</p>
<figure class="inline align-center">
<img alt="screenshot of the new index page" class="inline" src="screenshot-new-index.jpg" />
<figcaption>
<p>The index page design exactly match those intentions.</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>My advantage is that I have some modest graphic-design skills, allowing me to be quite
creative and make the whole process smoother and less frustrating. Still, where do I
start ?</p>
<p>If I look at my logbook, the first new design I come up with was a page to present
a &quot;photography sessions&quot; (i.e. a bunch of shots grouped together). Not very interesting,
but being able to add my photography portfolio was one of reason of that whole
website renovation so I started by having a look at what I could do there.</p>

<section id="the-importance-of-typography">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#toc-entry-5" role="doc-backlink">The importance of typography.</a></h3>
<p>I am not very good with typography, but I do love them. I love endlessy scrolling fonts
library or <a class="reference external" href="https://mastodon.gamedev.place/&#64;liamcollod/112388315897499867">visiting excentric designer website</a>
to find the perfect typeface.</p>
<p>However my process for finding fonts initially started as for most developer:
browsing Google Fonts. Just because it's convenient and easy to integrate in your website.
But fuck Google, I haven't migrated from Gmail to <a class="reference external" href="https://tuta.com/">Tuta</a> just to
have those blood-suckers also squatting my website. Fortunately I discovered a
workaround a few weeks ago: <a class="reference external" href="https://fonts.bunny.net/">https://fonts.bunny.net/</a>. It's has convenient as google
font to use, has all google fonts, but is not google. It just sucks for fiding fonts.</p>
<p>Still, why I am being so lazy ? I just said I love browsing fonts, I have bookmarked
quite a few typographic website so why do I stick with the &quot;google font library&quot; ? Just
because of the vendor-hosting ? Common you can just copy/paste a bunch of otf/ttf/woff
and write 2 lines of css. The real reason was mostly that I didn't need anything fancy,
the most popular fonts are in the Google catalogue and works just fine. But hey I said
I want to get fancy for this website ! Time to go off-road ...</p>
