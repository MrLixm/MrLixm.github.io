According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The ``bee``, of course, flies anyway because `bees` don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
*Ooh, black and yellow!*
**Let's shake it up a little.**
``Barry``! Breakfast is **ready**!

    ":abbr:`LGTM <looks good to me>`" he said, but if only he knew ...

Testing line blocks:

| Each new line begins with a
| vertical bar ("|").
|     Line breaks and initial indents
|     are preserved.
| Continuation lines are wrapped

time to test heading (this h2)
==============================

let's get into it

this should be h3
-----------------

another one bite the dust

and this is h4
______________

keep on digging

do we even have h5 ??

wow so much nesting


lists
=====

Bullet lists:

- This is item 1
- This is item 2

- Bullets are "-", "*" or "+".
  Continuing text must be aligned
  after the bullet and whitespace.

Enumerated lists:

3. This is the first item
4. This is the second item
5. Enumerators are arabic numbers,
   single letters, or roman numerals
6. List items should be sequentially
   numbered, but need not start at 1
   (although not all formatters will
   honour the first index).
#. This item is auto-enumerated

Definition lists:

what
  Definition lists associate a term with
  a definition.

how
  The term is a one-line phrase, and the
  definition is one or more paragraphs or
  body elements, indented relative to the
  term. Blank lines are not allowed
  between term and definition

links
=====

Regular link: https://github.com/MrLixm/MrLixm.github.io

This is an `interesting website <https://specificsuggestions.com>`_ !

----

Footnote references, like [5]_.
Note that footnotes may get
rearranged, e.g., to the bottom of
the "page".

.. [5] A numerical footnote. Note
   there's no colon after the ``]``.

----

Autonumbered footnotes are
possible, like using [#]_ and [#]_.

.. [#] This is the first one.
.. [#] This is the second one.

They may be assigned 'autonumber
labels' - for instance,
[#fourth]_ and [#third]_.

.. [#third] a.k.a. third_

.. [#fourth] a.k.a. fourth_

Auto-symbol footnotes are also
possible, like this: [*]_ and [*]_.

.. [*] This is the first one.
.. [*] This is the second one.

----

Citation references, like [CIT2002]_.
Note that citations may get
rearranged, e.g., to the bottom of
the "page".

.. [CIT2002] A citation
   (as often used in journals).

----

External hyperlinks, like Python_.

.. _Python: https://www.python.org/

tables
======

A simple table:

=====  =====  ======
   Inputs     Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True

A large table:

=================  ===========

code blocks
===========

And now some code:

.. code:: python

    from pathlib import Path
    import OpenImageIO as oiio

    def read_image(path: Path) -> oiio.ImageBuf:
        """
        Read given image from disk as oiio buffer.
        """
        return oiio.ImageBuf(str(path))

    def write_image(
        image: oiio.ImageBuf,
        dst_path: Path,
        compression: str,
        bitdepth: oiio.TypeDesc,
    ):
        if ":" in compression:
            compression, quality = compression.split(":")
            image.specmod().attribute("quality", int(quality))
        image.specmod().attribute("compression", compression)
        image.write(str(dst_path), bitdepth)
        if image.has_error:
            raise IOError(f"Cannot write image to disk: {image.geterror()}")

Or as literal block::

     def read_image(path: Path) -> oiio.ImageBuf:
        """
        Read given image from disk as oiio buffer.
        """
        return oiio.ImageBuf(str(path))

With lines :

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos: table

     def read_image(path: Path) -> oiio.ImageBuf:
        """
        Read given image from disk as oiio buffer.
        """
        return oiio.ImageBuf(str(path))

Overflowing :

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos: table

     def read_image(path: Path) -> oiio.ImageBuf:
        """
        This is hopefully a long enougg line of text so we can test how a code-block will render with a noticeable overflow.
        """
        return oiio.ImageBuf(str(path))


As a doctest:

>>> print("hello world")
Hello world !!! wait, it's not what I asked ?
>>> assert "üê∏" + "üß™" == "üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà"

With ``include`` directive:

.. include:: snippet.py
    :code: python

.. include:: snippet.py
    :literal:

custom highlight directive:

.. highlight::
    :class: note

    Will that works without a title ?


.. highlight::
    :class: note

    .. image:: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
        :alt: profile picture
        :target: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
        :width: 64px
        :align: left

    Duh of course it does


images
======

128px width image with target and alt

.. image:: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :alt: profile picture
    :target: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :width: 128px

Wit no alt and no target:

.. image:: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :width: 128px

Now testing align:

.. image:: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :width: 128px
    :align: left

.. image:: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :width: 128px
    :align: center

    :width: 128px
    :align: right

.. figure:: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :alt: profile picture
    :target: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :width: 128px

    Figure with no align set. Some more palceholder text.

.. figure:: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :alt: profile picture
    :target: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :width: 128px
    :align: center

    Figure with align=center.  Some more palceholder text.

.. figure:: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :alt: profile picture
    :target: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
    :width: 128px
    :align: right

    Figure with align=right. Some more palceholder text.


Using scale option:

.. image:: ../blog/windows-explorer-context-menu/command-prompt-maketx.png
    :target: ../blog/windows-explorer-context-menu/command-prompt-maketx.png
    :scale: 80%
    :alt: Command prompt after executing maketx.exe

Using width option:

.. image:: ../blog/windows-explorer-context-menu/command-prompt-maketx.png
    :target: ../blog/windows-explorer-context-menu/command-prompt-maketx.png
    :width: 80%
    :alt: Command prompt after executing maketx.exe


.. figure:: ../.static/images/cover-social.jpg
    :alt: profile picture
    :target: ../.static/images/cover-social.jpg
    :width: 512px
    :align: center

    Testing *nesting* other content in ``figure captions``:

    - list item 1
    - list item 2
    - list item 3

    .. figure:: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
        :alt: profile picture
        :target: ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
        :width: 64px
        :align: left

        figure-ception !

Testing ``.. image-grid::``


.. image-grid::

    ../.static/images/cover-social.jpg
    ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg

    ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg some caption that will be displayed under
    ../.static/images/cover-social.jpg the caption can span
        multiple lines if it's too long.
    ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg

Testing ``.. image-gallery::``

.. image-gallery::
    :left: image1
    :right: label1, image2, label2
    :left-width: 35
    :right-width: 65

    .. image-frame:: image1 label1 ../.static/images/profile-picture.jpg
        :metadata:
            date: 2024-11 early morning
            location: France - Lyon - Parc de la Tete d‚ÄôOr
            film: 35mm Kodak Gold 200
            lens: Minolta MD 35mm

        some of the text descrption of the image
        that can span multiple lines

    .. image-frame:: image2 label2 ../.static/images/cover-social.jpg
       :metadata:
            date: 2024-11 early morning
            location: France - Lyon - Parc de la Tete d‚ÄôOr
            film: 35mm Kodak Gold 200
            lens: Minolta MD 35mm

       some of the text descrption of the image
       that can span multiple lines
