[TOC]

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.
The `bee`, of course, flies anyway because _bees_ don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
*Ooh, black and yellow!*
**Let's shake it up a little.**

This is the first line  
This is the second line

## transitions

Testing transitions with different characters:

```
---

## time to test heading _(this h2)_

let's get into it

### this should be `h3` !


another one bite the dust

#### and this is h4

keep on digging

##### do we even have h5 ??

wow so much nesting

## lists

Bullet lists:

- This is item 1

  - nested bullet list
  - nest2

- This is item 2

- Bullets are "-", "*" or "+".
  Continuing text must be aligned
  after the bullet and whitespace.

  - nested bullet list


* item1
* item2
* item3


* item1 before blank line

* item 2 before blank line 


1986.\ What a great season. > this is the test where a numebred list is not trigerred
because it is escaped.


Enumerated lists:

1. This is the first item
2. This is the second item
3. Enumerators are arabic numbers,
   single letters, or roman numerals
4. List items should be sequentially
   numbered, but need not start at 1
   (although not all formatters will
   honour the first index).

## links

Regular link: https://github.com/MrLixm/MrLixm.github.io

This is an [interesting website](https://specificsuggestions.com) !

This is a [link with a title](https://liamcollod.xyz "my personal website")

Link to [the index page](/index/) ?

Automatic link <https://liamcollod.xyz> or mail <contact@liamcollod.eu> !

## references

This is a [reference][1]

[1]: https://liamcollod.xyz "my personal website"

Now a reference but without text [2][]

[2]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax

## footnotes

This is a footnote[^1] and another one [^2]

[^1]: the footnote content
[^2]: still nothing interesting to say

----

It also works with text like [^CIT2002].

[^CIT2002]: A citation (as often used in journals).

///Footnotes Go Here///.

A large table with code (that don't wrap)

## code blocks

And now some code:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import OpenImageIO as oiio

def read_image(path: Path) -> oiio.ImageBuf:
    """
    Read given image from disk as oiio buffer.
    """
    return oiio.ImageBuf(str(path))

def write_image(
    image: oiio.ImageBuf,
    dst_path: Path,
    compression: str,
    bitdepth: oiio.TypeDesc,
):
    if ":" in compression:
        compression, quality = compression.split(":")
        image.specmod().attribute("quality", int(quality))
    image.specmod().attribute("compression", compression)
    image.write(str(dst_path), bitdepth)
    if image.has_error:
        raise IOError(f"Cannot write image to disk: {image.geterror()}")
```

With lines :

```python {linenums="1"}
def read_image(path: Path) -> oiio.ImageBuf:
   """
   Read given image from disk as oiio buffer.
   """
   return oiio.ImageBuf(str(path))
```

Overflowing :

```python {linenums="1"}
def read_image(path: Path) -> oiio.ImageBuf:
   """
   This is hopefully a long enougg line of text so we can test how a code-block will render with a noticeable overflow.
   """
   return oiio.ImageBuf(str(path))
```

With title :

```python {linenums="1" title="My Cool Header"}
def read_image(path: Path) -> oiio.ImageBuf:
    """
    This is hopefully a long enougg line of text so we can test how a code-block will render with a noticeable overflow.
    """
    return oiio.ImageBuf(str(path))
```

```python {title="My Cool Header"}
def read_image(path: Path) -> oiio.ImageBuf:
   """
   This is hopefully a long enougg line of text so we can test how a code-block will render with a noticeable overflow.
   """
   return oiio.ImageBuf(str(path))
```
