As an artist, I found white-papers absolutely fascinating and so useful
to understand how the software we are using are built.
Even if platform like the `ACM digital library <https://dl.acm.org>`_ regroup
most of them, it can be hard to find only the pertinent one when you are
interested only about CGI in a VFX context.

So in my free-time I regrouped the one I find most pertinent, for the above
context, in a Notion database :

| I tried to keep most of them as "free" but some of them might be locked
 behind a paywall...
| As I'm someone that definitively think core knowledge should be lock behind
 a paywall I would absolutely NOT recommend to use `Sci-hub <https://sci-hub
 .mksa.top/>`_ to find a free illegal version of these paid papers. (here is
 the full url to be sure you doen't visit it https://sci-hub.mksa.top/).
