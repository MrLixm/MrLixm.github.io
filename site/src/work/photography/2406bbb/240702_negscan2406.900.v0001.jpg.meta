caption: Cities sucks because they are no place for animals, while walking where
    building are smaller and street narrower will probably get you the pleasure
    of meeting friendly cats. Like this gang of colorful fluff balls squatting
    this wobbly alley. Funnily I missed focus and made the void-like cat even more
    void-like, "him you shall not distinguish, shape-less body made of antimatter
    (except for the cute milky spots)".
