caption: Wandering through the narrow street of a residential neighbourhood,
    I passed a corner and immediatly saw there was a shot to take here.
    You got this very brutalist house facade in that sloppy street,
    large flat concrete surface with a massive red "2" sign made out of tiles.
    Some bushes appearing over the wall. The door was open revealing some stairs
    going higher up. I absolutely loved the place right away and I'm very
    happy to have it captured.
