caption: All around the school playground was this tall barrer of thin tubes
    with an exceptionally vivid blue color. Each of the tubes were spread wide enough
    so you could see what was going on on the other side while fulfilling its
    purpose of preventing the children from escaping and unleaching chaos in
    the city (that what school are for right ?). However empty of any children
    at that time, are left purposeless two trays on a pair of wheel ,
    with a similarly vivid blue color. All around, a bunch of tree are
    reflecting the sky of an end of the day, usually called "blue hour",
    which really is here !
