caption: Beware beast ! But who it is ? The biped creature holding its one eye or
    the cautious ball of fur questioning if he should not disapear quickly in the surrounding
    vegetation ? I would argue the biped with its green head is probably scarier than the
    fur ball that blends well with the residential concrete but you can't really judge this
    as only one of the two was framed here !
