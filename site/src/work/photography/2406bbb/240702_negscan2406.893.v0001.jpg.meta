caption: Through the grillin was this cut corner of garden, barely
    maintained and covered in vegetation. You could nearly miss the table
    set left there, despite its vivid color and mismatched chairs. I would
    definitively sit there for a cup of tea, as long as you are fine with
    ignoring the pesky photographer that would find you frame-worthy.
