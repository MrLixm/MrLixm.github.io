caption: Huh, what happens to that fountain, it's water is covered in
    colourful plastic bottle ! Hard to miss as being the brightest spot in the
    park, but that is what the Luzinterruptus collective wanted. Create a strong
    contrast to attract attention and create reflection around consumptions
    topics. Very clever.
