caption: How to turn a square into a fish tank ? Suspend fish in the air,
    and try to turn the atmosphere blue so it feel like underwater.
    Obviously don't use real fish. Those ones are neon tube drawing the silhouette
    of various fishes, which coupled with some fog and the contrast of the night
    create a magical ambiance which dragged a lot of people to wander among
    the luminous aquatic species.
