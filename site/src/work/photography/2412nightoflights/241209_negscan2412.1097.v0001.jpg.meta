caption: Another curious display of lights, numerous beams of light
    flashing all around, projecting onto the surrounding vegetation that give
    it volume. It's flashing in all direction, alternating strong menacing colours
    and softer ones. And we all stay there the head high, waiting to distinguish
    some pattern in that fest of light. But the camera captured what our eyes
    cannot, and the long seconds it was open for reveal the silhouette of the
    invisible tree that suddenly cut out well against a weirdly green sky.
