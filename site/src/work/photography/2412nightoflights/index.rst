        | :code:`∨` at night they appear,
        | ominous figure of light, dancing between the trees,
        | he looks friendly but is he ?
        | the unsettling green it cast feels otherwise ...

            camera: Nikon F100

        :code:`∧` A big structure of light effect was placed in a middle of the park
        field. Coloured waves of light slowing moving inside. It's pitch black all
        around so hard to judge the scale of the installation. But as people wanders
        around the display, their shadowy silhouette hint us at large display. Go on,
        sit down for a few minutes in the wet grass; and let your mind lost itself in
        the hypnotic waves of light it emits.

        :code:`<` Another curious display of lights, numerous beams of light
        flashing all around, projecting onto the surrounding vegetation that give
        it volume. It's flashing in all direction, alternating strong menacing colours
        and softer ones. And we all stay there the head high, waiting to distinguish
        some pattern in that fest of light. But the camera captured what our eyes
        cannot, and the long seconds it was open for reveal the silhouette of the
        invisible tree that suddenly cut out well against a weirdly green sky.

        :code:`∨` The rose garden is one of the most beautiful place of the park.
        It would usually looks bland at night but there, the numerous installation of
        colorous light tubes created a fascinating spectacle. A thin layer of fog was
        floating above its ponds to create an ethereal spectacle of light for
        its visitors.

        :code:`∨` Huh, what happens to that fountain, it's water is covered in
        colourful plastic bottle ! Hard to miss as being the brightest spot in the
        park, but that is what the Luzinterruptus collective wanted. Create a strong
        contrast to attract attention and create reflection around consumptions
        topics. Very clever.

        :code:`∨` How to turn a square into a fish tank ? Suspend fish in the air,
        and try to turn the atmosphere blue so it feel like underwater.
        Obviously don't use real fish. Those ones are neon tube drawing the silhouette
        of various fishes, which coupled with some fog and the contrast of the night
        create a magical ambiance which dragged a lot of people to wander among
        the luminous aquatic species.

        :code:`∧` A closer look inside the fish tank, there was this tree
        providing a nice foreground to hint a the very atmospheric
        background with some fish silhouette.
        It's so intensely blue, with rays of light everywhere.

It's also interesting that this session was a lot of "first" for me, first time
with Cinestill 800T, first time with the Nikon F100, first time shooting at night, but
most unfortunately first time having a development issue. I received my
negatives with a lot of thin dirt on them which was very visible once scanned. To this day
the lab still don't know why it happened (and only on that roll).
