caption: A big structure of light effect was placed in a middle of the park
    field. Coloured waves of light slowing moving inside. It's pitch black all
    around so hard to judge the scale of the installation. But as people wanders
    around the display, their shadowy silhouette hint us at large display. Go on,
    sit down for a few minutes in the wet grass; and let your mind lost itself in
    the hypnotic waves of light it emits.
