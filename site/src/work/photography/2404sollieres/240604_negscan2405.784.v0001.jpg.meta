caption: Lost in pine branches, a long trunk is emerging with a painted mark on it.
    No idea what It could mean. It's an horizontal white stripe on a messy deep brown background.
    Doesn't looks like the usual trail indication for hikers so perhaps some message
    from the forest management team ?
