caption: A beautiful rock. Wait a rock ? Beautiful ? How's that so ?
    Well it is half rock, half of a very white mineral stone leaving some crumbs at its top,
    a bit like a sugar coated pastry. If that doesn't make it at least interesting
    I don't know what to do for you.
    But what I love the most is all the young grows of saplings all around. We are
    actually in a mountainous river bed where water usually rise and falls so young trees
    usually don't make it until the next season. But for now they are all around, growing
    through the rocks and breaking the dull stone with spots of green freshness.
