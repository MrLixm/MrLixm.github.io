caption: Someone left it's vintage bike on the garden's terrace, and I thought it would
    make a cool shot. It sits next to an heterogenous set of flower pots, except
    there's not much flower yet. I love the floor of that terrace, a large expanse of
    concrete, now aged by the time. But what's cool are the slabs,
    there's not really square, but all slightly curved. Which somehow breaks the cold,
    the boring of the stone.
