caption: Amongst the lushy vegetation, abandoned man-made objects. A pottery,
    lost on its small stone wall. Blessed by the few sun that escape, from the bamboo
    forest it sits near by. But it's not the only one, the garden is scattered, of those
    pretty art pieces. Perhaps for the bugs to enjoy them ?
