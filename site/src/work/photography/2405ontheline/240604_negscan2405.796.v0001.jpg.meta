caption: Moments before going out in the garden, I look up in the corner of the door.
    A beautiful glass door is reflecting the soft sky while a whole family of young
    ivy leaves are hanging out above it. In the background the bright sky reveal the
    silouhette of a plane tree whose foliage create an ocean of colored spots inviting
    you to take a swim.
