caption: I was wandering in the living room and my eye got stuck on that small
    table for a second. What a mess it was, but so intriguing. Books and magazine
    of all sort, accompanied by various vases. The one with the most fancy shape
    was actually holding a small plants with very smooth round leaves.
    I had to take the shot. Also next-to-it another beautiful
    ceramic with a smooth olive color that nicely contrast with the plant.
