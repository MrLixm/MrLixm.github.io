caption: I looked up and slighty above me was this opened window. Emerging
    from the shadow of the interior I noticed some tropical plants that probably
    occupy the most luminous place of the apartment. This led me to press the
    shutter. Now that I can view the result I really like how the film stock
    rendered the blue of the sky reflecting on the window, which go in pair
    with the typical french blue street sign attached on the left.
