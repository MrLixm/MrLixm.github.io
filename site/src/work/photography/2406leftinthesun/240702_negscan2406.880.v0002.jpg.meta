caption: Ivy is an incredible plant. Eating up as much space as possible while
    defying gravity. This clump was interesting too shoot as being a very dense
    clump on a small area of a big white house, with a strong sun beam right on it !
    Some stone walls in the foreground nicely layer the picture and give
    some charm to the composition.
