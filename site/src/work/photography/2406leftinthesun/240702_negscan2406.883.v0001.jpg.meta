caption: Turning around the corner I quickly notice the big window of what
    is maybe a studio or other working place. The large piece of glass were
    covered in dust and most interestingly a lot of tropical plants left behind
    them. I took the shot parallel to the window creating nice straight geometrical
    shape that works well with the wall architecture.
