caption: Not a beauty shot per say, a dusty scooter was parked outside next to
    some tagged trash bins. A probably broken suitcase was also left rotten there.
    However the old stone wall and massive wooden portal with a vivid sky blue
    color nicely brings some interest in this mundane scene.
    For some reason I found the frame of the film fitting for this shot and didn't
    cropped it out.
