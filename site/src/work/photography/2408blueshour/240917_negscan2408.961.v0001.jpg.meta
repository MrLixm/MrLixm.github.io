caption: Day reaching its end,


    You sit under the tree,


    And free the mind from distraction.


    You look up at the leaves,


    All silhouette you distinguish,


    Rounded shapes of shadows,


    there's just black, and blues,


    no more room for the doubts,


    Is that peace you feel ?
