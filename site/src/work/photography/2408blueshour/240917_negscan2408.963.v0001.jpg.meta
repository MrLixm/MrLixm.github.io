caption: It feels so cold, yet so warm. The light is getting thin, but still
    painting splash of warmth here and there. Take your turn on the used bench, to
    breath for a minute. But make sure you sit on the right side to catch
    the last sun beam. You wouldn't want to feel cold, wouldn't you ?
