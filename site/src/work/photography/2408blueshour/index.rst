        :code:`⇓` It feels so cold, yet so warm. The light is getting thin, but still
        painting splash of warmth here and there. Take your turn on the used bench, to
        breath for a minute. But make sure you sit on the right side to catch
        the last sun beam. You wouldn't want to feel cold, wouldn't you ?

        | :code:`⇑` Rigid geometry of stairs,
        | through messy vegetation.
        | The sun is about to leave,
        | but still warmer than ever,
        | projecting messy shadows
        | on the cold old concrete.

        :code:`⇐` This corner of the park was pretty mundane, a large gravel aread
        ending on a small forest of bamboo. And at this time of the day there's not
        much visible. But stronger than ever, a small beam of light came to pierce
        through the surrounding vegetation to light a spot of ground. And just like
        that the small corner suddenly become worth looking at. A beautiful contrast of
        warm sun and peaceful shadows with splashs of chlorophyles emerging from it.

        | :code:`⇒` Day reaching its end,
        | You sit under the tree,
        | And free the mind from distraction.
        | You look up at the leaves,
        | All silhouette you distinguish,
        | Rounded shapes of shadows,
        | there's just black, and blues,
        | no more room for the doubts,
        | Is that peace you feel ?
