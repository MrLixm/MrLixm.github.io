caption: This corner of the park was pretty mundane, a large gravel aread
    ending on a small forest of bamboo. And at this time of the day there's not
    much visible. But stronger than ever, a small beam of light came to pierce
    through the surrounding vegetation to light a spot of ground. And just like
    that the small corner suddenly become worth looking at. A beautiful contrast of
    warm sun and peaceful shadows with splashs of chlorophyles emerging from it.
