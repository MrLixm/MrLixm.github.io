caption: What's going on behind that metal fence ? There is some red-painted bottles
    sticked on rusty poles, and an as-much-rusty sign with a very naive skull painted
    on it. That clearly a sign to not go further but why ? Which is a pity because
    the area is gorgeous, with the sunset embrathing in warmth
    the mediterranean vegetation.
