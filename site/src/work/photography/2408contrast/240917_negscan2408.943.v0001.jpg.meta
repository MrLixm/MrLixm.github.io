caption: Emerging from the dark, barely lit by a soft cold light source,
    was clumps of what seemed to be dried leaves. Hard to guess but it's actually
    orchidae flowers in bad shape. And then we have the light leak. Ferrociously
    blasting a stripe of the scene with an intense agressive red.
