caption: You may know I like green, so I had to take a shot at this
    beautiful sign I stumbled upon while taking the other night shots. It reads a
    simple "Le Limonadier" in a kind of vintage yellow font which nicely contrast
    with the intense green background. All wrapped in a simple circle shape with a
    white light outline spilling on the wall it is attached to.
