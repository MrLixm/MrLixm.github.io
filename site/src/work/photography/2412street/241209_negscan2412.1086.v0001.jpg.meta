caption: A narrow passage stuck between building. You think it could looks
    creepy at this time of the night, but its not that dark. A vintage lamp hung at
    the ceilling is shining strong as it can and reveals the silhouette of a couple
    holding hands, nicely silhouetted by the bright store-front of a "Tabac" in the
    background. Not that dark, lovely actually !
