caption: "What a lovely street", I went as few seconds later I was setting up
    the tripod to shoot it. Obviously the cobble plays a lot, I love how much
    character it gives over the traditional flat asphalt. But the most interesting
    was that little one level tall building, squeezed at the back of the street
    between large walls of much taller buildings. Today being the 8th of December,
    its occupant placed candles at every window as the tradition wants, giving it
    even more charm. I was not the only one who find that piece of scenery worth
    the look, as I was about to take the shot, someone walked in the street and
    stopped to look at the small building for a second, hence triggering me to
    finally release the shutter and take the shot.
