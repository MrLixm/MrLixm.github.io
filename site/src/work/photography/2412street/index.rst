        :code:`>` "What a lovely street", I went as few seconds later I was setting up
        the tripod to shoot it. Obviously the cobble plays a lot, I love how much
        character it gives over the traditional flat asphalt.  But the most interesting
        was that little one level tall building, squeezed at the back of the street
        between large walls of much taller buildings. Today being the 8th of December,
        its occupant placed candles at every window as the tradition wants, giving it
        even more charm. I was not the only one who find that piece of scenery worth
        the look, as I was about to take the shot, someone walked in the street and
        stopped to look at the small building for a second, hence triggering me to
        finally release the shutter and take the shot.

        :code:`<` Despite the biting cold of December the mood is festive. It's the
        light celebration day here in Lyon and people are looking for some warmth at
        the snack bar installed along the river. The scene is so stunning, where
        stands' garlands blend between warm and cold splash of lights,
        creating beautiful reflections in the wet asphalt.

        :code:`<` Everybody home, street are mostly empty, if not for the late buses
        still going on. It would be quite dark without the street lamps whose light
        slowly fade in the fog of the night. The atmosphere gets unfriendly as
        invisible clouds start spraying a thin rain over it all. It's getting very cold
        so, maybe it's time to get home ? But there something in that atmosphere that
        feels captivating, and you decide to stay for a few seconds more ...

        :code:`>` You may know I like green, so I had to take a shot at this
        beautiful sign I stumbled upon while taking the other night shots. It reads a
        simple "Le Limonadier" in a kind of vintage yellow font which nicely contrast
        with the intense green background. All wrapped in a simple circle shape with a
        white light outline spilling on the wall it is attached to.

        :code:`âˆ§` A narrow passage stuck between building. You think it could looks
        creepy at this time of the night, but its not that dark. A vintage lamp hung at
        the ceilling is shining strong as it can and reveals the silhouette of a couple
        holding hands, nicely silhouetted by the bright store-front of a "Tabac" in the
        background. Not that dark, lovely actually !
