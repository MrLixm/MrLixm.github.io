caption: Despite the biting cold of December the mood is festive. It's the
    light celebration day here in Lyon and people are looking for some warmth at
    the snack bar installed along the river. The scene is so stunning, where
    stands' garlands blend between warm and cold splash of lights,
    creating beautiful reflections in the wet asphalt.
