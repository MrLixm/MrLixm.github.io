caption: Look up ! Rising from dense clumps of leaves, swarming with sun,
    emerges the very spiky corner of a house, perfect geometric shape cut out
    against an immaculate open sky. There's lot of light, there's quite some shadow,
    few in between, the kind of place you could just sit at and let your mind lost
    itself to the relaxing sound of birds chirping.
