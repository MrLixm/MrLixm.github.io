caption: If buildings had a texture this one would feel quite funky but
    interesting for sure. You got the usual large windows surface of modern
    buildings but it get interesting with the railway circling it at each floor,
    which gets punctually traversed by big smooth tubes going to the roof.
    A weird mix of order and chaos.
