caption: We are in November but it doesn't feel like it.
    There's this gorgeous flowerbed bathing in the sun which looks so goood.
    It has plants of all shapes and forms, but colors only alternate between the
    vivid red of flowers and the freshness of the chlorophyll. You have spiky kind
    of yucca, dense grapes of flowers, smooth textured leaves and dense
    actinomorphic flowers. A healthy salad of plants to calm whatever mess
    is going on in your life.
