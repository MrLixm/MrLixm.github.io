        :code:`<` If buildings had a texture this one would feel quite funky but
        interesting for sure. You got the usual large windows surface of modern
        buildings but it get interesting with the railway circling it at each floor,
        which gets punctually traversed by big smooth tubes going to the roof.
        A weird mix of order and chaos.

        :code:`∧` Look up ! Rising from dense clumps of leaves, swarming with sun,
        emerges the very spiky corner of a house, perfect geometric shape cut out
        against an immaculate open sky. There's lot of light, there's quite some shadow,
        few in between, the kind of place you could just sit at and let your mind lost
        itself to the relaxing sound of birds chirping.

        :code:`∨` We are in November but it doesn't feel like it.
        There's this gorgeous flowerbed bathing in the sun which looks so goood.
        It has plants of all shapes and forms, but colors only alternate between the
        vivid red of flowers and the freshness of the chlorophyll. You have spiky kind
        of yucca, dense grapes of flowers, smooth textured leaves and dense
        actinomorphic flowers. A healthy salad of plants to calm whatever mess
        is going on in your life.

        :code:`>` "Boring" could describe this corner of garden, but I think it's not.
        There's not much going on but there a lot too. A mix of textures and shapes,
        sun playing with shadows. You have floating ivy leaves covering the ground,
        scattered pine needles and soft small flowers piercing through. And over this
        vegetation carpet, sit a single fallen dead leaf as an outsider.
