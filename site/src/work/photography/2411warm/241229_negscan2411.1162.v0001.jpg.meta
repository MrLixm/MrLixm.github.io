caption: "Boring" could describe this corner of garden, but I think it's not.
    There's not much going on but there a lot too. A mix of textures and shapes,
    sun playing with shadows. You have floating ivy leaves covering the ground,
    scattered pine needles and soft small flowers piercing through. And over this
    vegetation carpet, sit a single fallen dead leaf as an outsider.
