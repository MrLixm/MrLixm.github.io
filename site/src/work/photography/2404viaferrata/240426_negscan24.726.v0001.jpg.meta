caption: While we are on a quite flat portion of the trail, I'm taking the opportunity
    to turn back and take a shot at the distance we have covered. A few hundred of meters
    since the footbrige allowing to cross the riff, and the start of the Via-ferrata.
    We are at the middle of the two massive cliffs surounding us and luckly,
    a shadowy area that is most welcomed after the previous part that was
    under a hard-hitting sun.
    I can even see the rope-bridge we took to join the other cliff side and that cross
    over the river that lines the bottom of that rift we are in.
