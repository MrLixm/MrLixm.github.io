caption: It would be crazy hard to climb this, near-vertical chunk of rock. Fortunately
    we are doing a Via-ferrata, and convenient poles of steel have been incrusted in
    the cliff, forming a ladder. Lil'brother is having a go at it, wearing the perfectly
    adequate equipment: hiking shoes, blue helmet, sunglasses, pant and obvisouly
    his climbing harness.
