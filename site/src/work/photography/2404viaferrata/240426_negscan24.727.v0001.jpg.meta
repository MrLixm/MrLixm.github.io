caption: I hope you don't have vertigo ! One hand holding the metalic bar that keep
    me hooked to the cliff, the other for the camera and looking straight down !
    A few dozen of meter down there the bottom of the riff, a river and some rocks.
    But don't hope the river would catch an accidental fall, it's rather this kind of
    mountainous shallow stream that have way less water at this period.
