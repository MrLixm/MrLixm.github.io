caption: We've been climbing for hours but we've reached the end ! And what an end,
    after only seeing rocks and beat up by the tough altitude sun. Finally some trees
    and their welcome shade; a forest of pines to be exact.
    There's a cute but strong stream winding down through the forest, but hey what's this ?
    There's a cool suspended bridge over it !
