        :code:`<` Flowers are definitively always a hit to photograph. Roses make no exceptions,
        with their deep relaxing foliage color that strongly contrast with the explosive
        red of its petal. But that day, it looked even better. It has frosted, deposing
        a thin layer of cold crystals over those delicate petals. And it felt so cold,
        but somehow the flower presence brought an intense warmth.

        :code:`<` Floating by the bank of the lake, unbothered,
        moisturized. Happy. A duck ? Is it though ? Because I’m not good at birds and
        it has an uncommon plumage, black from the back, from white to the head, with a
        dark spot around the eye. Anyway, that’s a cool bird, chilling under the
        beautiful foliage of an autumnal tree, breaking the calm water surface
        with satisfying ripples.

        :code:`∧` It’s cold as fuck, the frozen grass crunchs under
        your steps, no sign of the sun to warm it all.
        Though the park’s garden is beautiful, with most of the plant covered by a thin
        layer of cold powder. The water of the pond hasn’t frozen but you can imagine
        how cold it must feel, to just dip a toe. But despite the conditions, one brave
        small tree exhibit its vivid red flowers, bringing a welcome touch of
        warm in that cold atmosphere.

        :code:`>` I don’t know what feels so peaceful about lakes,
        they just are. Especially early when there is no one around. The pedalo rental
        hasn’t opened yet (and will probably not this season?) and the boats are
        patiently waiting stacked on the shore. Despite the cold it’s a soft and cuddly
        morning, as the rising sun tries to pierce through thick clouds. A delicate
        wind moves some waterside plants with a fuzzy feel. It’s good to sit there and
        just listen, to the noise of leaves dancing.
