caption: Flowers are definitively always a hit to photograph. Roses make no exceptions,
    with their deep relaxing foliage color that strongly contrast with the explosive
    red of its petal. But that day, it looked even better. It has frosted, deposing
    a thin layer of cold crystals over those delicate petals. And it felt so cold,
    but somehow the flower presence brought an intense warmth.
