caption: It’s cold as fuck, the frozen grass crunchs under
    your steps, no sign of the sun to warm it all.
    Though the park’s garden is beautiful, with most of the plant covered by a thin
    layer of cold powder. The water of the pond hasn’t frozen but you can imagine
    how cold it must feel, to just dip a toe. But despite the conditions, one brave
    small tree exhibit its vivid red flowers, bringing a welcome touch of
    warm in that cold atmosphere.
