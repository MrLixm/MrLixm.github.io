caption: A giraffe on a stone pillar, intriguing right ? It signed Lasco, yes
    the same name as those prehistoric caves. And it make sense when you wander
    around Lyon, you will catch numerous of its other pieces on the city wall,
    all with the same theme: animals painted like we were 2.8 millions years back
    in the past. But the canvas has changed. As eye-catchy as it is my shot was
    missing something ... So I decided to not invert the negative. Bright stone
    and cold sky turn to darker warm shades, and the giraffe now nicely layer
    like an upper relief on its canvas. And the grass, turn to funky purple shades,
    quite unsettling ? But maybe that plays nicely with what the street-artist
    wanted, prehistoric drawings in our modern era is quite intriguing right ?
