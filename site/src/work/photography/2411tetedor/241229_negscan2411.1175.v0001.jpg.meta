caption: I don’t know what feels so peaceful about lakes,
    they just are. Especially early when there is no one around. The pedalo rental
    hasn’t opened yet (and will probably not this season?) and the boats are
    patiently waiting stacked on the shore. Despite the cold it’s a soft and cuddly
    morning, as the rising sun tries to pierce through thick clouds. A delicate
    wind moves some waterside plants with a fuzzy feel. It’s good to sit there and
    just listen, to the noise of leaves dancing.
