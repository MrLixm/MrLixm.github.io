caption: Floating by the bank of the lake, unbothered,
    moisturized. Happy. A duck ? Is it though ? Because I’m not good at birds and
    it has an uncommon plumage, black from the back, from white to the head, with a
    dark spot around the eye. Anyway, that’s a cool bird, chilling under the
    beautiful foliage of an autumnal tree, breaking the calm water surface
    with satisfying ripples.
