caption: An interesting contrast between the very vivid green bush leaves
    and the cold grey body of a car parked against it.
    Car which was left probably since quite some time as a copious amount of dirt was
    covering it. Dirt which was starting to exhibit funny-looking zig-zagging patterns.
    Probably due to the rain ?
