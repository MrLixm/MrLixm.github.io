caption: Who said leaves are boring. Getting a closer look at the one hanging
    in the back of the garden and they are gorgeous. Emerging out of the darkness
    of the bush, elongated oval shapes with a vivid green tint and impeccable
    reflective coating. There's something in my brain telling me that I need to touch
    those leaves, to feel their plasticy-smooth texture.
