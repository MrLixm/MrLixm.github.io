caption: From the ground they arise, distorted beams of metal.
    Installed by some creative minds, seeking to catch the eye, of some park
    passers-by, that may find the contrast, pleasing to look at.
    Sun plays its part, helped by the trees, warming-up the cold steel,
    so it's not all gris.
