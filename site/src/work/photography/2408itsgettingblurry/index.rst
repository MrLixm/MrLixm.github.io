It's getting blurry
===================

:description: through thick chemicals clouds, few light reach us, somehow forming, picture of empty places.

        :code:`∨` At a corner of the building, where streets cable join, a pair of shoe
        hanging there, defying gravity thanks to a thin shoe lace. Mushy shadows and
        immaculate sky, why is it so dusty ?

        :code:`∧` Hidden behind the trees, massive block of concrete.
        I'm told people lives there, lost in the emptiness of the sky, taking turns for
        who gets to have the sun. Until it fades away, and all share the noisy night.

        :code:`<` Those object you don't look at, part of our mundane life,
        populating our spaces with purpose. Take a moment to stop on them, maybe the
        light hitting it right, maybe the shape is odd, or maybe it got though hands
        of some street artists, but maybe it's not that bland.
        And when you got all of those, then more than mundane it become,
        like this trash you shouldn't care. But covered in scribbles,
        a red plank caught in warm light, it's actually really nice.

        :code:`>` Massive beam of light, piercing though empty sky. Creating infinite horizon,
        made to lost the mind. Trees become noise, details lost in the warmth. Perfect
        way to wrap the day, down there at the park.

        :code:`∨` Fuzzy mix of warm noise, lighter speckles all over.
        It feels warm it feels dark. And abstract you might think ?
        But inspect for longer, ... suddenly you notice,
        silhouetted by bright light, messy shape of vegetation. Covering grey block of
        what probably is, building of a city.
