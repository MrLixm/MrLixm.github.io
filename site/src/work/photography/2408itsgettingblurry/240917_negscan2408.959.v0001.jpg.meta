caption: Those object you don't look at, part of our mundane life,
    populating our spaces with purpose. Take a moment to stop on them, maybe the
    light hitting it right, maybe the shape is odd, or maybe it got though hands
    of some street artists, but maybe it's not that bland.
    And when you got all of those, then more than mundane it become,
    like this trash you shouldn't care. But covered in scribbles,
    a red plank caught in warm light, it's actually really nice.
