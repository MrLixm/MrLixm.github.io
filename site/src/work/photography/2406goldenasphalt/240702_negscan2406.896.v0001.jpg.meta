caption: Lost against a sea of concrete and noisy band of asphalt are those
    flower boxes. At this time of the day, a strong but soft sun is turning
    those pale flowers into a vivid bouquet.
    The perfect contrast contrast with the cold shadows of the road down there.
    Snapping the picture right at the
    good time, a black car is passing in the background, its deep red taillight
    more noticeable than the vehicle itself.
