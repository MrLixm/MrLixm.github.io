caption: Some funky architecture on the side of a window-less building.
    Two archs whose seems to not be that recent, catching some of an end-of-day
    sun. Also noticeable is that foregound, highly out-of-focus but which
    outline what seems to be a barbed wire fence.
    There is not much noticeable element in that shot but colors are all over it,
    with avery pastel palette going from a golden yellow to a washed purple and
    some very dark greens.
