caption: You go down the stair and get greeted by an incredible sunny view.
    The sun is blasting that building so strong we don't even distinguish it
    from the sky ! If it was not for the bushy vegetation all around, indicating
    its silouhette. Vegetation which is actually so lushy we could fear that the car
    parked near would be quickly covered by it. The place really doesn't feel like a city,
    small messy and sloping building dispersed through vegation, it feels confy.
