caption: End of the day is the perfect time for film photography (and even
    photography in general), the kid playground had beautiful golden color
    everywhere, embracing it all in warmness. Some bushy plants form a nicely layered
    foreground which match the vivid green color of the slides in the back.
    Slides whose shinny metal is reflecting the sun at the right angle,
    creating a tiny flare and bringing even more sun into the picture.
