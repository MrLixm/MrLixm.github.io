caption: End of the day on the city, people are riding back from work to
    their home, leading quite some traffic on this popular uphill. On a bridge
    above it, I capture that line of car. But its no borring road, there
    is a lot vegetations all around it catching some of the last warmth
    sun beams. Barely noticeable in the background, we can see the taller
    building of the financial district that nealy merge with the
    clear blue sky.
