caption: It's the end of a hot summer day. A tired sun is brushing the top of
    taller buildings in its warmth. Swallows are swimming through the big blue
    sky spotted with delicate cloud clumps.
    I pointed the camera up, that building had the perfect lighting,
    with a sun beaming perfectly the beautiful brick chimney at its top.
