I am managing a small server dedicated mostly to posting resources for progamming
in the vfx industry. There's usually not much discussion on it but there is a lot of resources.

Examples of resources tags:

.. highlight::
    :class: hint

    ``python``, ``c++``, ``osl``, ``lua``, ``pipeline``, ``memes``

    ``Qt``, ``PySide``, ``Maya``, ``Houdini``, ``Nuke``, ``Katana``, ``Mari``, ``Substance``
