    I had my logo since september 2016 and I think it was time for a change.
    I wanted to keep the same vibe, but get a less agressive look, hence the
    rounded corners everywhere. I also found the shape too complex to read and
    tried to simplify it. Interestingly the new shape works way less than
    the previous one, when viewed with a very small scale.
