It's there ! After so much time, Substance-Painter finally saw it-self getting
a shiny new color-management system with OCIO support. We're going to dive
deeper inside and see how it works :

.. note-info::

    OCIO was introduced in `Substance-Painter version 7.4 <https://substance3d.adobe.com/documentation/spdoc/version-7-4-223053247.html>`_

    This is the version used through this article and some features might
    have changed since.

New project

Color-management is not application-dependant but project-dependant.
As such, you will not find any options in the applications settings but in
the project one.

The first occurence of these new option can be fin on the ``New project``
window. You will find a ``Color Management`` sub-menu at the bottom.

.. note-info::

    You can change all the color-management settings at any moment in
    the project settings. Keep in mind that big changes could break your
    project thought.

You will be offered between two modes ``Legacy`` and ``OpenColorIO``.
``Legacy`` corresponds to the pre-release way sp was working with. We will
skip this mode as it not usefull anymore.

.. note-info::

    Even if you don't need to use any specific OCIO config, substance offer a
    default one for the sRGB workflow which made **the OCIO mode recommended
    to use.**

OCIO options
------------

But wait, wait ... what is OCIO ? Why should I use it ?

`OCIO <https://opencolorio.readthedocs.io>`_
is a color-management solution developed originaly by Sony Picture Imageworks
aiming at enforcing color-management consistency between DCCs.
I recommend `having a read at the documentation <https://opencolorio
.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concepts/overview/overview.html>`_ .

OCIO itself only define standards of utilisation and give you the tools to work
but the core of the system is the **OCIO config** (a ``.ocio`` file).
This is where all the color-transforms and options are defined.
For example ACES is a color-management system on his own but ship a version
through OCIO.

Main advantage is that OCIO is supported by most software (even if the
implementation wildy differs between each ðŸ˜¬ ) so you could get the same look
through all of your DCCs (in theory).

.. transition:: ~

For our convenience sp already ship with 3 OCIO configs :

- Substance
- ACES 1.0.3
- ACES 1.2

You can find them in the sp installation folder like this one :

::

    C:\Program Files\Allegorithmic\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\resources\ocio

Honestly I don't know why did they included two ACES version, only the last
one was needed, but it is awesome to have a default "Substance" config.

Picking an OCIO config
======================

| Lot of flexibility here. First option being to use the shipped configs.
 On my opinion only the ``Substance`` config is interesting here.
| The 2 ACES one are the "default" dev configs with the hundred of
 colorspaces you will never need. It is better to use a lightweight ACES
 config like `the one from CAVE academy <https://caveacademy
 .com/product/cave-cg-animation-aces-ocio-config/>`_.

The ``Substance`` config will be a good fit if you are using the tradional
sRGB linear workflow and do not wish to use an OCIO config in every DCC.
You will still have enough control to have a proper color-managed workflow.

Let's now see how you could load a custom OCIO config.

.. transition:: ~

Custom config
_____________

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0008/sp-project-ocio-custom.png
    :target: {static}/images/blog/0008/sp-project-ocio-custom.png
    :alt: New project window with OCIO option set with a custom config.

The first option is to use the ``Custom`` option and the manually look for
the path to the ``config.ocio`` file on your disk.


.. block-warning:: Only a reference to the config path is saved in the project.

    When submiting a OCIO config through the ``Custom`` option, **the config is always
    loaded live from the disk**. This mean if you share a substance project with
    someone that doesn't have the OCIO config at the same exact path you will
    see this message pop up :

    .. image:: {static}/images/blog/0008/sp-project-ocio-custom-error.png
        :target: {static}/images/blog/0008/sp-project-ocio-custom-error.png
        :alt: Error window when the custom config can't be found.

See the bottom section `Default parameters for OCIO configs`_ to continue
the setup.

Environment variable
____________________

The above might be enough for indivual artist but being in a pipeline
environement will require other way to set OCIO automaticaly.

.. note-info::

    If the OCIO environment variable is present and has a valid configuration
    file it will take over to override and disable the UI settings.

On Windows you have 2 way to set environment variable :

Global Settings
"""""""""""""""

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0008/ocio-env-global.png
    :target: {static}/images/blog/0008/ocio-env-global.png
    :alt: Windows creating the OCIO environment variable.

You create a new variable named OCIO with the path to the config.
This variable will be used by ALL software that can read it. (unless
overriden).

This is not a recommended solution as you polute your environment variable + if
you decide to switch the config for an other one all your previous project
will be broken.

Setted localy at startup
""""""""""""""""""""""""

You defined the environment variable in a start-up script.
This is the cleanest way to do it but means you can't use the Windows shortcut
to start your software :

We use a ``.bat`` to configure and launch the software. Here is a basic ``.bat``
that will set the OCIO variable and then launch sp.

.. code:: shell

    set "OCIO=C:\aces_1.1\config.ocio"

    "C:\Program Files\Allegorithmic\Adobe Substance 3D Painter\Adobe Substance 3D Painter.exe"

.. note-default::

    To create a ``.bat`` just create a new ``.txt`` file, paste the above code,
    modify it with the path to your config, save it, and then just replace
    the ``.txt`` with ``.bat`` in the file's name.

| This mean that to launch Substance you will have to always use this .bat.
 No "double-clicking" on file to open them either.
| You can have a look on internet at `how to pin a .bat to the taskbar
 <https://superuser.com/questions/656611/how-to-pin-a-batch-file-to-the
 -taskbar-quicklaunch/656649>`_ .

But this guarantee a very robust software configuration per project.

Default parameters for OCIO configs
===================================

    OCIO with Substance config properly configured.


This correspond to all the section bellow the color-management mode. It allow
to configure on inputs reacts with the OCIO config, i.e which colorspace is
being assigned by default.

Usually in other software this section is configured using the `OCIO roles
<https://opencolorio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/authoring/overview
.html#roles>`_ defined in the OCIO configuration.
:text-danger:`But currently sp doesn't support OCIO roles.` Instead it is
using the ``working colorspace`` as a default colorspace everywhere, which mean
:text-danger:`you have to manually setup this section` to get correct result
with the auto settings.
