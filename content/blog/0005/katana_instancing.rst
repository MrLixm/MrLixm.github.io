Katana, as its usual, doesn't offers "ready to go" solution for instancing.
This initial complexity can be overcome by the fact that we can create an
instancing solution that exactly suits our needs. And that is what what we
are going to adress in this post.
Additionnaly I will explain how I tried to create a flexible solution for
instancing called ``kui``.
And lastly you will find a paragraph specific to `Redshift`_ where I had some
troubles guessing what it needed to work.

Intro
-----

As the Katana's motto states : *Itâ€™s all just a bunch of Attributes.* And it's
apply to instances too. They are just a bunch of location with a defined
list of attributes understood by your render-engine.
You can as such create an instance with a simple
``LocationCreate + AttributeSet`` setup *(if you have time to loose)*. But we
will be using OpScripts to do so.

Here is a quick diagram that could resume how an instance is built :

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/intro.png
    :alt: instancing principle

The basic principle is that an ``instance`` links at least to one
``instance source`` (a scene-graph location).
The instance will create a "copy" of this instance source. You can then set
transformations overrides that will allow the instance having a different
position, rotation, etc, than the source.
Aditional attributes can also be set and used for shading to make the
instance even more different than the source.


Instancing Methods
------------------

Instancing comes in different flavor, that, similarly to all things, have
specific ups and down. You render-engine may also supply alternative ways to
produce instances so be sure to check its documentation on the topic.

Here is what the Katana documentation say about this:

.. url-preview:: https://support.foundry.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006999219
    :title: Q100518: Instancing Overview

Leaf-level
==========

*(Never used this one)*

`The Katana documentation <https://support.foundry
.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006999259>`_ is pretty explicit.

.. container:: m-row

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-danger:: cons

            Major drawback is that you can't have a location with children
            locations (to verify),
            and well it seems every render-engine has a way to decide which
            location is the first one to instance ðŸ™‚.

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-success:: pros

            You just have to set a single attribute.

            You can easily apply modification on a single instance.
            *(ex: a Transform3D)*


*Would love to know in what case this one can be more pertinent than the other methods.*

Hierarchical
============

Each instance = one scene-graph location.

.. container:: m-row

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-danger:: cons

            Too much instances (>~100 000) will lead you to performances
            issues. (pre-render)

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-success:: pros

            You can easily apply modification on a single instance.
            *(ex: a Transform3D)*

Array
=====

One single scene-graph location where each instance correspond to an index
on each attribute.

.. container:: m-row

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-danger:: cons

            Complicated to get per-instance override.

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-success:: pros

            Better performances.


.. transition:: ~

And there is probably some aditional pro/cons inheritent to your render-engine
so again, check the documentation, and test stuff.
(For example , when I started to explore instancing, Redshift was not supporting
locations with children when using the ``array`` method.)

Instancing in Practice
----------------------

To start, there is a nice small example on the `official Katana documentation
<https://learn.foundry.com/katana/Content/ug/instancing/rendering_instances.html>`_
. It explains how to create instance using mostly Katana nodes and one small
OpScript to avoid stacking numerous ``AttributeSet`` nodes.
This approach is pretty basic : we manually set how much instances we want to
create and we need to manually move them. The setup also
take times to build and is not very scalable.

A more widely used solution depends on ``point-clouds`` : a type of location
composed of visual abstract "points" in the 3d space that can hold an
arbitrary number of attributes based on the point index.

You use each individual point's attribute to create an instance. For example,
each point can specify what kind of instance source it is representing, ...
Furthermore it's "abstract" aspect make it very convenient for transfering data
between DCCs.

A convenient way to create scene graph locations based on a source object like
a point-cloud, is to use the `OpScript
<https://learn.foundry.com/katana/Content/ug/working_with_attributes
/opscript_nodes.html>`_ feature. It is an entry door to use scripting while
staying in the Katana nodegraph system. Usage of OpScript require to learn
the `lua language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)>`_
. But don't worry, if you don't want to get your hands dirty you will be able
to use a premade script/node shared in the `Katana Uber Instancing`_ section.

To create scene graph location we need to know how it must be structured.
For this what's better than having a look at the documentation :
`AttributesConventions/Instancing <https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4
.5/dev-guide/AttributeConventions/Instancing.html>`_. You notice that we
find the 3 instancing methods described again.

Let's now start building the scene.

Scene-Preparation
=================

For you to follow the tutorial, I will be providing you some assets. Actually
only a point-cloud, as to keep it simple, instances sources will be
primitives.

.. url-preview:: https://mega.nz/folder/uooQzJJR#5aguo_c3gLXPrkEnN62ZBg
    :title: Sources Files Download
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/mega.svg

    15KB folder on mega.nz

This point-cloud has been generated from Mash (see `mash2pointcloud
<https://github.com/MrLixm/Autodesk_Maya/tree/main/src/mash2pointcloud>`_)
and contains the most-commonly used attributes.

Here is what it looked like in Maya :

.. image-grid::

    {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-maya-01.png
    {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-maya-02.png

And here is the instances-sources mapping list :
::

    0: cube
    1: cone
    2: sphere


Here it is imported in Katana :

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-01.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot.

I also used a small OpScript that allow me to set the viewer size of the
points. You can `grab the OpScript here <https://github.com/MrLixm/
Foundry_Katana/tree/main/src/viewer/PointcloudWidth>`_.

In the ``Attributes`` tab we can see what are the attributes stored on the
point-cloud. This one has :

- ``arbitrary``
    - ``scale`` : XYZ per-point scale attribute.
    - ``rotation``: XYZ per-point rotation attribute
    - ``objectIndex``: per-point index to use for instance-source
    - ``colorRandom``: per-point random color
- ``point``
    - ``P`` : XYZ per-point transform
    - ``v`` : per-point velocity
    - ``width`` : added via the OpScript for viewer size.

All the attributes in the ``arbitrary`` section doesn't really have a naming
convention. You must know which name corresponds to which type of data for when
you are creating the OpScript that produce the instances.

.. block-info:: PointCloud Instancing without OpScript

    Depending of your render-engine , it might actually supports directly
    rendering the point-cloud and generating the instances on the fly !
    Like Arnold does `as explained here <https://docs.arnoldrenderer
    .com/display/A5KTN/pointcloud+and+instance+array>`_. But it excepts
    specific attributes in the ``point`` group.

For the instance-sources we will be using simple primitives as detailed above.
You can use ``PrimitiveCreate`` node to create them. My final "initial"
nodegraph is looking like this :

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-02.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot.

Now it's time to have a look at OpScripting.

OpScript-Preparation
====================

We are going to manipulate a lot of inputs and data and at some point we
will need to see what X variable equal to, what the result of X operation, etc
to just be able to know where we need to go scripting-wise. Usually this is
done by using the ``print()`` function. But this is very basic and can led to
various limitations.

To have a more robust way of debugging OpScripts I made myself a small
logging module in lua. Kind of similar to what Python logging module does.
It add a bunch of line to your script but will allow more flexibility in the
way data will be displayed to you.

On top of a freshly created ``.lua`` file paste the content of this file :

.. url-preview:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana/main/src/utility/lua_logger/lllogger.lua
    :title: llloger.lua
    :image: https://github.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana/raw/main/src/utility/lua_logger/cover.png

    A simple lua logging module based on Python one.


We will then be able to use the logger methods to output message to the
console. *(This just wrap the ``print()`` function which in Katana, output the
result in the console that should be opened alongside your Katana)*

.. code:: lua

    logger:debug("any object")
    logger:info("any object")
    logger:warning("any object")
    logger:error("any object")

.. note-info::

    Alternatively, to avoid having to paste so much code you can use it as a
    lua module. See the `README.md <https://github.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana
    /tree/main/src/utility/lua_logger>`_ for instructions.

All this steps **are not mandatory**. They just help for faster debugging.
*(And pertinent if you want to write lua code by yourself.)*

Basic Instancing : Hierarchical
===============================

For a first try we will be using the OpScript provided on the Foundry's
documentation. It's the most basic you can do which will be perfect for an
introduction. It's the one for the hierarchical method.

Create an OpScript node and paste the bottom script inside the ``script.lua``
parameter

.. include:: opscript.hierarchical.foundry.lua
    :code: lua

If you look at the first lines you can see that we are getting some
``OpArg`` values. On OpScript nodes this correspond to ``user`` parameters.
This means we will need to create two of them.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-03.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: OpScript parameters.

You should have noticed the first script's limitation, we can only give one
instance-source for now. But let's keep that for later. Set the 2 created user
parameters value with their corresponding locations. *(! the pointcloud is the
location of type* ``pointcloud`` *, not its parent "group".)*

| We need to provide one
 last input, the target destination for our instances. For this, change the
 ``applyWhere`` parameter to ``atSpecificLocation`` and then in the
 ``location`` param at top,
 submit the desired target location for your instances.
| I will be using ``/root/world/geo/instancing/demo``.

Now let's view the OpScript node, and expand the target location in the
SceneGraph to see our instances.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-04.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot:SceneGraph instances.

.. block-info:: Instances preview in the Viewer

    Since **Katana 4.5**, it is now possible to view instances in the Viewer.
    You need to set instance-source location ``type`` to ``instance source``
    *(more on that below)* and make sure the instance-sources and the
    instances are set to be viewed in the Viewer.

    Be careful thought, as if your instance-sources are heavy meshes, you
    might end-up with an unresponsive Viewer.

    More details `in this video <https://youtu.be/VYRjWw6biEQ>`_.

Yay, that was quick to have something working. But check the Attributes on one
of the instance.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-05.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: Instance Attributes.
    :scale: 80%

If you have a look at the ``xform.interactive`` attributes, we can see that
only the ``translate`` attribute has non-default values. This is because our
current OpScript only read the ``P`` attribute on the point-cloud which
correspond to the instance translations.

| You can notice that all the ``geometry`` attributes from the instance-source
 have also been copied. This is because the script copy all the root attributes
 of the instance-source :

.. code:: lua

    24  gb:set("childAttrs", Interface.GetAttr("", instanceSourceLocation))

This would allow to have the bounds attribute on the instance, so we have at
least some primitive representation in the viewer. But the ``geometry``
attributes are not needed because they are copied from the instance-source
at render-time. To fix this, the instance-source location would need to be a
group with the mesh inside.

Now, what we should not forget, is cleaning the scene for rendering. This
means :

| 1. Hide the pointcloud (cause you render-engine will probably render the
 points as spheres).
| You can use a ``VisibilityAssign`` node for this.

| 2. Hide the instances-sources.
| This can be graciously done by setting the type of the instance-source
 location to ``instance source``.
| You can use an ``AttributeSet`` node for this.

.. note-info::

    Setting a location type to ``instance source`` will make it invisible in
    the viewer, in the render and allow to preview the instances in the viewer
    (with Katana >= 4.5).

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-06.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: AttributeSet node.

Annnnd, we can try to fire-up a render to see our instancing result.
Nothing very exciting, using primitives doesn't looks very impressive. You
can have a try with any asset, just instance it's top-most location. Here is
the result with an "heavy" asset :

.. figure:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-07.gif
    :alt: Katana Viewer GIF: rendering house instances.

    100 x 3.2 mi vertices house asset, 1920x1080, 3Delight

And if you need it, here is the Katana file :

.. url-preview:: {static}/blog/0005/demo.hierarchical.basic.katana
    :title: Download sources files.
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/file-katana.svg
    :svg-size: 60


Basic Instancing : Array
========================


Before trying to go further with hierarchical we are going to have a look with
the ``array`` method. Keep the same scene, we will only need to change the
OpScript.

And here it is. It's a slightly modified version from the one on
Foundry's website. (better readability + bugs fixed)

.. include:: opscript.array.foundry.lua
    :code: lua

You still need to create 2 ``user`` parameters on the OpScript node, but
this time ``user.instancesSourceLocations`` must be a string array of scene
graph-locations.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-08.gif
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: OpScript user paramaters.

And of course the same ``user.pointCloudLocation`` one. The ``location``
parameter still define where the instance is created but this time it's not
the group holding the instances, but directly the full location of the instance
(array instance is only one scene-graph location).

Make sure the OpScript is running and then check the attribute on the
``instance array`` location created.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-09.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: Instance Array Attributes.

This time we are able to use our different instance-sources and not only one
and we have an ``InstanceIndex`` attribute that specify which
instance-source to use per-point. But if we look at more closely at the
OpScript lua script, we notice the index are generated mathematically
instead of using our point-cloud's ``objectIndex`` attribute. This will need
to be adressed later of course.

We can also notice that we are not using the traditional "translate" attribute,
but a matrix one. Matrices have the advantages of replacing 4 attributes
with 1 (translations, rotations(X, Y, Z)) but are harder to modify
"on-the-fly". In the ends choose what suits you bets for your workflow.

To know what kind of attributes are supposed to be supported by each
instancing method, we can have a look at the documentation:

.. url-preview:: https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4.5/dev-guide/AttributeConventions/Instancing.html
    :title: Instancing -- Katana Developer Guide
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/katana.svg
    :svg-size: 60

Only the Array method require specific attributes as all instances are
represented by one scene-graph location.

Full Instancing
===============

Aight' that was a quick first look at instancing, but as mentioned, we were
not using all the exported attributes on our point-cloud. Supporting them
require extending the basics OpScripts we used but this will be too long
for this blog-post. Instead I'm just going to give the code logic you could
be using if you want to go down that road. Else you will find a fully working
solution in the `Katana Uber Instancing`_ section.

Full Instancing : Hierarchical
==============================

Hierarchical using single location per-instance, they can use the commonly
used attributes for locations like ``xform``. This transformation attributes
are described in the docs : `dev-guide/AttributeConventions/Transformations
<https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4.5/dev-guide/AttributeConventions/
Transformations.html>`_. So pretty easy to implement, in pseudo-code :

.. include:: pseudo_code.hierarchical.01.lua
    :code: lua


If you are now wondering who to determine which instanceSource to use, the
logic is pretty simple :

.. include:: pseudo_code.hierarchical.02.lua
    :code: lua

And you could then do the same for abitrary attributes like ``colorRandom``.
The only difference could be the target destination on the instance. You
must check your render-engine documentation for that, but usually it's :

.. include:: pseudo_code.hierarchical.03.lua
    :code: lua

And finally just as ""educational"" purposes, here is the code I used on
a Redshift production. It's not that documented and is probably not very clean
so use it at you own risks. Again i recommend to instead have a look at ``kui``.

.. url-preview:: {static}/blog/0005/opscript.hierarchical.liam.lua
    :title: OpScript | Hierarchical | Redshift
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/file-code.svg
    :svg-size: 60



Advanced workflows
==================

Modifying point-clouds | Transforms
___________________________________

You might stumble apon the case where you can't re-generate the point-cloud and
you have to move it in Katana. But we can't use our good old ``Transform3D``
friend here because , well, the transformations data is stored in geometry
attributes, and the ``Transform3D`` only modify the ``xform`` attribute !

But no need to worry I got u a solution on my GitHub :

.. url-preview:: https://github.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana/tree/main/src/viewer/PointcloudXform2P
    :title: PointcloudXform2P
    :image: https://github.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana/raw/main/src/viewer/PointcloudXform2P/demo.gif

    Allow merging xform transformations on a pointcloud location to
    the geometry.point.P attribute.

As mentioned, the OpScript only modify the ``P`` attribute , this mean only
the ``translation`` and ``rotation`` from the ``Transform3D`` are applied.


.. note-info::

    But you might not need this as your render-engine probably supports the
    use of ``Transform3D`` on the instance(s). (even if the Viewer preview
    ignore it, in render, the instance are properly transformed.)


Modifying point-clouds | Culling
________________________________

Another need would be to prune points so no instance is produce at this
location. Even if instancing improve performances compared to no instancing,
more instances still costs at render-time so you wanna make sure you are not
rendering non-contributing instances.

.. TODO finish by including a culling script.


Katana Uber Instancing
----------------------

As we just saw, instancing can require in some cases quite some work before
having a result. That's why I tried to produce a solution that would be very
flexible with a very straightforward setup.

The goal here will be to create an 'uber' instancing node (just a group node
actually) where, using the same parameters, you could conveniently switch
between different instancing methods and have a lot flexibility on inputs.
(Leaf-level will be excluded as I'm not familiar with it.)


R&D
===

Let's first think at what could be the ``source`` of the instances data. A most
common case would be to use a point-cloud. We could also see an even more
flexible solution by allowing to use any location, like a locator.

The next step will be to extract the ``source`` attributes and convert them to
individual instances attributes. That's where we will meet a new issue :

| We know the destination of these attributes : scale, rotation, index, color,
 ..., we know that at least one of them will be present.
 But what is very variable is how they are named, what are the one that we
 actually need, etc. The first way to fix this issue is to define pipeline
 conventions, where X type of attribute should have X name, and so teh X name
 is hardcoded into your script. But production needs change often, and we can
 agree that having a script with as minimal hardcoded conventions as possible
 is better.
| The second solution is to have a way to specify to the script the name of
 the attributes present on the ``source`` and how to behave with them.
 We could do this using user arguments on the OpScript but I feel we can
 have an even more logicial solution that would be to have these infos on the
 ``source`` itself.

So the ``source`` would have a bunch of attributes which have a fixed naming
convention (we can't escape it) that will gave the script the info require
to process the ``source``. It will be more clear when applied to the script.



OpScript-Getting What We Need
=============================




Redshift
--------

The production where I had to look for instancing was using Redshift,
and unfortunately it seems that, at that time, the instancing features where
"minimally" implemented and some stuff was missing/broken.
Fortunately, Redshift developer's Juanjo was very responsive and very quickly, fixed
all the issues I found. Discussion can be found `in this thread
<https://redshift.maxon.net/topic/33461/more-documentation-for-instancing-in-katana?_=1634997159560>`_.
