Katana, as usual, doesn't offer a "ready to go" solution for instancing.
This initial complexity can be overcome by the fact that we can create an
instancing solution that exactly suits our needs. And that is what we
are going to address in this post.
Additionally, I will explain how I tried to create a flexible solution for
instancing called ``kui``.
And lastly, you will find a paragraph specific to `Redshift`_ where I had some
troubles guessing what it needed to work.

Intro
-----

As Katana's motto states : *Itâ€™s all just a bunch of Attributes.* And it
applies to instances too. They are just a bunch of locations with a defined
list of attributes understood by your render-engine.
You can as such create an instance with a simple
``LocationCreate + AttributeSet`` setup *(if you have time to lose)*. But we
will be using OpScripts to do so.

Here is a quick diagram that could resume how an instance is built :

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/intro.png
    :alt: instancing principle

The basic principle is that an ``instance`` links at least to one
``instance source`` (a scene-graph location).
The instance will create a "copy" of this instance source. You can then set
transformations override that will allow the instance to have a different
position, rotation, etc, than the source.
Additional attributes can also be set and used for shading to make the
instance even more different than the source.


Instancing Methods
------------------

Instancing comes in different flavors, that, similarly to all things, have
specific ups and downs. Your render-engine may also supply alternative ways to
produce instances so be sure to check its documentation on the topic.

Here is what the Katana documentation say about this:

.. url-preview:: https://support.foundry.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006999219
    :title: Q100518: Instancing Overview

Leaf-level
==========

*(Never used this one)*

`The Katana documentation <https://support.foundry
.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006999259>`_ is pretty explicit.

.. container:: m-row

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-danger:: cons

            Major drawback is that you can't have a location with children
            locations (to verify),
            and well it seems every render-engine has a way to decide which
            location is the first one to instance ðŸ™‚.

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-success:: pros

            You just have to set a single attribute.

            You can easily apply modification on a single instance.
            *(ex: a Transform3D)*


*Would love to know in what case this one can be more pertinent than the other methods.*

Hierarchical
============

Each instance = one scene-graph location.

.. container:: m-row

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-danger:: cons

            Too many instances (>~250 000) will lead you to performances
            issues. (pre-render)

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-success:: pros

            You can easily apply modification on a single instance.
            *(ex: a Transform3D)*

Array
=====

One single scene-graph location where each instance correspond to an index
on each attribute.

.. container:: m-row

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-danger:: cons

            Complicated to get per-instance override.

    .. container:: m-col-s-6

        .. block-success:: pros

            Better performances.


.. transition:: ~

And there is probably some additional pro/cons inherent to your render-engine
so again, check the documentation, and test stuff.
(For example, when I started to explore instancing, Redshift was not supporting
locations with children when using the ``array`` method.)

Instancing in Practice
----------------------

To start, there is a nice small example on the `official Katana documentation
<https://learn.foundry.com/katana/Content/ug/instancing/rendering_instances.html>`_
. It explains how to create instances using mostly Katana nodes and one small
OpScript to avoid stacking numerous ``AttributeSet`` nodes.
This approach is pretty basic: we manually set how many instances we want to
create and we need to manually move them. The setup also
takes time to build and is not very scalable.

A more widely used solution depends on ``point-clouds``: a type of location
composed of visual abstract "points" in the 3d space that can hold an
arbitrary number of attributes based on the point index.

You use each individual point's attribute to create an instance. For example,
each point can specify what kind of instance source it is representing, ...
Furthermore, its "abstract" aspect makes it very convenient for transferring
data between DCCs.

A convenient way to create scene graph locations based on a source object like
a point-cloud, is to use the `OpScript
<https://learn.foundry.com/katana/Content/ug/working_with_attributes
/opscript_nodes.html>`_ feature. It is an entry door to use scripting while
staying in the Katana nodegraph system. Usage of OpScript require to learn
the `lua language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)>`_
. But don't worry, if you don't want to get your hands dirty you will be able
to use a premade script/node shared in the `Katana Uber Instancing`_ section.

To create scene graph locations we need to know how they must be structured.
For this what's better than having a look at the documentation :
`AttributesConventions/Instancing <https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4
.5/dev-guide/AttributeConventions/Instancing.html>`_. You notice that we
find the 3 instancing methods described again.

Let's now start building the scene.

Scene-Preparation
=================

For you to follow the tutorial, I will be providing you a few assets. Actually
only a point-cloud, as to keep it simple, instances sources will be
primitives.

.. url-preview:: https://mega.nz/folder/uooQzJJR#5aguo_c3gLXPrkEnN62ZBg
    :title: Sources Files Download
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/mega.svg

    15KB folder on mega.nz

This point-cloud has been generated from Mash (see `mash2pointcloud
<https://github.com/MrLixm/Autodesk_Maya/tree/main/src/mash2pointcloud>`_)
and contains the most commonly used attributes.

Here is what it looked like in Maya :

.. image-grid::

    {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-maya-01.png
    {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-maya-02.png

And here is the instances-sources mapping list :
::

    0: cube
    1: cone
    2: sphere


Here it is imported in Katana :

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-01.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot.

I also used a small OpScript that allow me to set the viewer size of the
points. You can `grab the OpScript here <https://github.com/MrLixm/
Foundry_Katana/tree/main/src/viewer/PointcloudWidth>`_.

In the ``Attributes`` tab we can see what are the attributes stored on the
point-cloud. This one has :

- ``arbitrary``
    - ``scale`` : XYZ per-point scale attribute.
    - ``rotation``: XYZ per-point rotation attribute
    - ``objectIndex``: per-point index to use for instance-source
    - ``colorRandom``: per-point random color
- ``point``
    - ``P`` : XYZ per-point transform
    - ``v`` : per-point velocity
    - ``width`` : added via the OpScript for viewer size.

All the attributes in the ``arbitrary`` section don't have a naming
convention. You must know which name corresponds to which type of data for when
you are creating the OpScript that produce the instances.

.. block-info:: PointCloud Instancing without OpScript

    Depending on your render-engine , it might actually support directly
    rendering the point-cloud and generating the instances on the fly !
    Like Arnold does `as explained here <https://docs.arnoldrenderer
    .com/display/A5KTN/pointcloud+and+instance+array>`_. But it excepts
    specific attributes in the ``point`` group.

For the instance-sources we will be using simple primitives as detailed above.
You can use ``PrimitiveCreate`` node to create them. My final "initial"
nodegraph is looking like this :

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-02.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot.

Now it's time to have a look at OpScripting.

OpScript-Preparation
====================

We are going to manipulate a lot of inputs and data and at some point, we
will need to see what X variable is equal to, what is the result of X
operation, etc
to just be able to know where we need to go scripting-wise. Usually, this is
done by using the ``print()`` function. But this is very basic and can lead to
various limitations.

To have a more robust way of debugging OpScripts I made myself a small
logging module in lua. Kind of similar to what Python logging module does.
It adds a bunch of line to your script but will allow more flexibility in the
way data will be displayed to you.

On top of a freshly created ``.lua`` file paste the content of this file :

.. url-preview:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana/main/src/utility/lua_logger/lllogger.lua
    :title: llloger.lua
    :image: https://github.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana/raw/main/src/utility/lua_logger/cover.png

    A simple lua logging module based on Python one.


We will then be able to use the logger methods to output messages to the
console. *(This just wrap the ``print()`` function which in Katana, output the
result in the console that should be opened alongside your Katana)*

.. code:: lua

    logger:debug("any object")
    logger:info("any object")
    logger:warning("any object")
    logger:error("any object")

.. note-info::

    Alternatively, to avoid having to paste so much code you can use it as a
    lua module. See the `README.md <https://github.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana
    /tree/main/src/utility/lua_logger>`_ for instructions.

All these steps **are not mandatory**. They just help for faster debugging.
*(And pertinent if you want to write lua code by yourself.)*

And by the way, if this is your first time with OpScript, the documentation
can be a bit confusing at first. It is split into multiple "modules" with
different language bindings. The one we use the most often is the
CookInterface :

.. url-preview:: https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4.5/dev-guide/OpsAndOpScript/CookInterface/OpScript.html
    :title: Cook Interface (OpScript).
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/katana.svg
    :svg-size: 60


Basic Instancing : Hierarchical
===============================

For a first try, we will be using the OpScript provided on the Foundry's
documentation. It's the most basic you can do which will be perfect for an
introduction. It's the one for the hierarchical method.

Create an OpScript node and paste the bottom script inside the ``script.lua``
parameter

.. include:: opscript.hierarchical.foundry.lua
    :code: lua

If you look at the first lines you can see that we are getting some
``OpArg`` values. On OpScript nodes this corresponds to ``user`` parameters.
This means we will need to create two of them.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-03.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: OpScript parameters.

You should have noticed the first script's limitation, we can only give one
instance-source for now. But let's keep that for later. Set the 2 created user
parameters values with their corresponding locations. *(! the pointcloud is the
location of type* ``pointcloud`` *, not its parent "group".)*

| We need to provide one
 last input, the target destination for our instances. For this, change the
 ``applyWhere`` parameter to ``atSpecificLocation`` and then in the
 ``location`` param at the top,
 submit the desired target location for your instances.
| I will be using ``/root/world/geo/instancing/demo``.

Now let's view the OpScript node, and expand the target location in the
SceneGraph to see our instances.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-04.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot:SceneGraph instances.

.. block-info:: Instances preview in the Viewer

    Since **Katana 4.5**, it is now possible to view instances in the Viewer.
    You need to set instance-source location ``type`` to ``instance source``
    *(more on that below)* and make sure the instance-sources and the
    instances are set to be viewed in the Viewer.

    Be careful though, as if your instance-sources are heavy meshes, you
    might end up with an unresponsive Viewer.

    More details `in this video <https://youtu.be/VYRjWw6biEQ>`_.

Yay, that was quick to have something working. But check the Attributes on one
of the instance.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-05.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: Instance Attributes.
    :scale: 80%

If you have a look at the ``xform.interactive`` attributes, we can see that
only the ``translate`` attribute has non-default values. This is because our
current OpScript only read the ``P`` attribute on the point-cloud which
correspond to the instance translations.

| You can notice that all the ``geometry`` attributes from the instance-source
 have also been copied. This is because the script copies all the root
 attributes of the instance-source :

.. code:: lua

    24  gb:set("childAttrs", Interface.GetAttr("", instanceSourceLocation))

This would allow having the bounds attribute on the instance, so we have at
least some primitive representation in the viewer. But the ``geometry``
attributes are not needed because they are copied from the instance-source
at render-time. To fix this, the instance-source location would need to be a
group with the mesh inside.

Now, what we should not forget, is cleaning the scene for rendering. This
means :

| 1. Hide the pointcloud (cause you render-engine will probably render the
 points as spheres).
| You can use a ``VisibilityAssign`` node for this.

| 2. Hide the instances-sources.
| This can be graciously done by setting the type of the instance-source
 location to ``instance source``.
| You can use an ``AttributeSet`` node for this.

.. note-info::

    Setting a location type to ``instance source`` will make it invisible in
    the viewer, in the render and allow to preview the instances in the viewer
    (with Katana >= 4.5).

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-06.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: AttributeSet node.

Annnnd, we can try to fire up a render to see our instancing result.
Nothing very exciting, using primitives doesn't look very impressive. You
can have a try with any asset, just instance it's top-most location. Here is
the result with a "heavy" asset :

.. figure:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-07.gif
    :alt: Katana Viewer GIF: rendering house instances.

    100 x 3.2 mi vertices house asset, 1920x1080, 3Delight

And if you need it, here is the Katana file :

.. url-preview:: {static}/blog/0005/demo.hierarchical.basic.katana
    :title: Download sources files.
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/file-katana.svg
    :svg-size: 60


Basic Instancing : Array
========================


Before trying to go further with hierarchical we are going to have a look at
the ``array`` method. Keep the same scene, we will only need to change the
OpScript.

And here it is. It's a slightly modified version from the one on
Foundry's website. (better readability + bugs fixed)

.. include:: opscript.array.foundry.lua
    :code: lua

You still need to create 2 ``user`` parameters on the OpScript node, but
this time ``user.instancesSourceLocations`` must be a string array of scene
graph-locations.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-08.gif
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: OpScript user paramaters.

And of course the same ``user.pointCloudLocation`` one. The ``location``
parameter still define where the instance is created but this time it's not
the group holding the instances, but directly the full location of the instance
(array instance is only one scene-graph location).

Make sure the OpScript is running and then check the attribute on the
``instance array`` location created.

.. image:: {static}/images/blog/0005/demo-katana-09.png
    :alt: Katana Interface screenshot: Instance Array Attributes.

This time we can use our different instance-sources and not only one
and we have an ``InstanceIndex`` attribute that specify which
instance-source to use per point. But if we look more closely at the
OpScript lua script, we notice the index are generated mathematically
instead of using our point-cloud's ``objectIndex`` attribute. This will need
to be addressed later of course.

We can also notice that we are not using the traditional "translate" attribute,
but a matrix one. Matrices have the advantages of replacing 4 attributes
with 1 (translations, rotations(X, Y, Z)) but are harder to modify
"on-the-fly". In the end choose what suits you best for your workflow.

To know what kind of attributes are supposed to be supported by each
instancing method, we can have a look at the documentation:

.. url-preview:: https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4.5/dev-guide/AttributeConventions/Instancing.html
    :title: Instancing -- Katana Developer Guide
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/katana.svg
    :svg-size: 60

Only the Array method require specific attributes as all instances are
represented by one scene-graph location.

Full Instancing
===============

Aight' that was a quick first look at instancing, but as mentioned, we were
not using all the exported attributes on our point-cloud. Supporting them
requires extending the basics OpScripts we used but this will be too long
for this blog-post. Instead, I'm just going to give the code logic you could
be using if you want to go down that road. Else you will find a fully working
solution in the `Katana Uber Instancing`_ section.

Full Instancing : Hierarchical
==============================

Hierarchical is using single location per-instance, they can use the commonly
used attributes for locations like ``xform``. This transformation attributes
are described in the docs : `dev-guide/AttributeConventions/Transformations
<https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4.5/dev-guide/AttributeConventions/
Transformations.html>`_. So pretty easy to implement, in pseudo-code :

.. include:: pseudo_code.hierarchical.01.lua
    :code: lua

In the code I wrote in the past, my target was ``xform.interactive`` but
this is wrong as the xform is not interactive like with a Transform3D ! You
should use ``xform.groupN`` convention instead.

.. note-warning::

    ``Xform`` attributes are very sensitive :

    - You have to make sure the order is respected as followed :

    ::

        translation
        rotationZ
        rotationY
        rotationX
        scale
        matrix

    - You have to make sure all the above attributes are ``DoubleAttributes``. Else you might have surprises at render-time.

If you are now wondering who to determine which instanceSource to use, the
logic is pretty simple :

.. include:: pseudo_code.hierarchical.02.lua
    :code: lua

And you could then do the same for arbitrary attributes like ``colorRandom``.
The only difference could be the target destination on the instance. You
must check your render-engine documentation for that, but usually, it's :

.. include:: pseudo_code.hierarchical.03.lua
    :code: lua

And finally just for ""educational"" purposes, here is the code I used on
a Redshift production. It's not that documented and is probably not very clean
so use it at your own risk. Again I recommend instead having a look at
``kui``.

.. url-preview:: {static}/blog/0005/opscript.hierarchical.liam.lua
    :title: OpScript | Hierarchical | Redshift
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/file-code.svg
    :svg-size: 60


Full Instancing : Array
=======================

Array is in a way more simple, you can just brainless copy the attributes
from the point-cloud to the instance (if they are properly formatted).
Make sure to `check the documentation <https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4
.5/dev-guide/AttributeConventions/Instancing.html>`_ about what kind of
attribute is excepted.
Pseudo code is looking like this :

.. include:: pseudo_code.array.01.lua
    :code: lua

Yup, that is that easy if you only need translations.

To add rotations, you will need to split the incoming point-cloud attribute
into X,Y and Z and add the axis direction. Works the same as for hierarchical.
And imagine you are using a matrix instead. Even less code to write.


.. note-warning::

    All attributes are very sensitive to the way they are build:

    - You have to make sure the order is respected as followed :

    ::

        matrix
        translation
        rotationZ
        rotationY
        rotationX
        scale

    -
        You have to make sure all the above attributes are ``DoubleAttributes``
        (and other attributes like ``instanceIndex`` also have the correct type
        specified in the documentation).
        Else you might have surprises at render-time.


Anyway here was the solution I used in prod, same blah blah as for
hierarchical...

.. url-preview:: {static}/blog/0005/opscript.array.liam.lua

Advanced workflows
==================


Instances preview in the Viewer
_______________________________

Since **Katana 4.5**, it is now possible to view **instance array** in the
Viewer :

-
    You need to set instance-source location ``type`` to ``instance source``.

-
    Make sure the instance-sources and the instance are set to be viewed in
    the Viewer (location expanded or "eye" checked for all the instance source
    hierarchy).

âš  Be careful though, as if your instance-sources are heavy meshes, you
might end up with an un-responsive Viewer.

More details `in this video <https://youtu.be/VYRjWw6biEQ>`_. Or in the
`Katana 4.5 patch-note <https://learn.foundry
.com/katana/Content/release_notes/whats_new_4.5
.html#PreviewInstancesandRendersintheHydraViewer>`_.

The above also apply to *hierarchical* even if not specified in the notes.
For Katana < 4.5, there is no real solution for *arrays*, but there is one for
*hierarchical* that make use of the ``proxies.viewer`` attribute :

.. url-preview:: https://learn.foundry.com/katana/4.0/Content/ug/scene_data/proxies_good_data.html
    :title: Proxies and Good Data for Users
    :svg: {static}/images/global/icons/katana.svg
    :svg-size: 60

    This solution require to have a pre-generated proxy alembic for your
    instance-source.

The attributes have to be set on the instances itself.
But it would be less work to set these attributes on the instance-source and
then make sure your OpScript copies the local attributes from the
instance-source to the instance
( with ``Interface.GetAttr("", instanceSourceLocation)``).

Nothing prevent you to also set it on an *array instance*, but this requires
to have already pre-generated an exactly similar-looking alembic.

Modifying point-clouds | Transforms
___________________________________

You might stumble upon the case where you can't re-generate the point-cloud and
you have to move it in Katana. But we can't use our good old ``Transform3D``
friend here because, well, the transformations data is stored in geometry
attributes, and the ``Transform3D`` only modify the ``xform`` attribute !

But no need to worry I got u a solution on my GitHub :

.. url-preview:: https://github.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana/tree/main/src/viewer/PointcloudXform2P
    :title: PointcloudXform2P
    :image: https://github.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana/raw/main/src/viewer/PointcloudXform2P/demo.gif

    Allow merging xform transformations on a pointcloud location to
    the geometry.point.P attribute.

As mentioned, the OpScript only modify the ``P`` attribute, meaning only
the ``translation`` and ``rotation`` from the ``Transform3D`` are applied.


.. note-info::

    But you might not need this as your render-engine probably supports the
    use of ``Transform3D`` on the instance(s). (even if the Viewer preview
    ignores it, in render, the instances are properly transformed.)


Modifying point-clouds | Culling
________________________________

Another need would be to prune points to reduce instances. Even if instancing
improve performances compared to when not used,
more instances still costs at render-time so you wanna make sure you are not
rendering non-contributing instances.

For this you could try to see Efthymis's OpScript :

.. url-preview:: https://efthymisb.gumroad.com/l/tsrvn
    :title: Frustum Culling OpScript for Katana
    :image: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/752132517405917204/937006446695038986/frustumCulling_thumbnail.gif

    This OpScript creates Attributes based on if the geometry/point is inside the Camera's Frustum Culling.

    - Hide geometry that is outside of the Frustum (from the viewport)
    - Set Visibility Attribute (for render)
    - Create Attributes based on distance from the camera.
    - Create instanceSkipIndex attribute for PointClouds.

.. TODO finish by including a culling script.


Katana Uber Instancing
----------------------

As we just saw, instancing can require in some cases quite some work before
having a result. That's why I tried to produce a solution that would be very
flexible with a very straightforward setup.

The goal here was to create an 'uber' instancing node (just a group node
actually) where, using the same parameters, you could conveniently switch
between different instancing methods and have a lot of flexibility on inputs.
(Leaf-level has been excluded as I'm not familiar with it.)

The project is available on GitHub here :

.. TODO edit the link when published
.. url-preview:: https://github.com/MrLixm/Foundry_Katana/tree/kui/src/instancing/kui
    :title: KUI - Github Repository

I let you check the README.md that should provide all the instructions
necessary to use this tool.


Redshift
--------

The production where I had to look for instancing was using Redshift,
and unfortunately, it seems that, at that time, the instancing features where
"minimally" implemented and some stuff was missing/broken.
Fortunately, Redshift developer's Juanjo was very responsive and very quickly,
fixed all the issues I found. Discussion can be found `in this thread
<https://redshift.maxon.net/topic/33461/more-documentation-for-instancing-in-katana?_=1634997159560>`_

Didn't tested the latest version but I think you should now get the same

``geometry.arbitrary`` is supported ?
