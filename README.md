This is my personal website, portfolio and blog.

Made using [Pelican](<https://blog.getpelican.com/>) as the static site
generator.
A customized version of [m.css](https://mcss.mosra.cz/>) is used as theme.

## development

The development of the website is done on the `main` branch. It is recommended
to create a branch from it and merge back later using a pull-request.

### pre-requisites

- `git` is available
- Windows operating system

### usage

See the [./dev](./dev) package to see the tools accessible.

```shell
python -m dev --help
```
